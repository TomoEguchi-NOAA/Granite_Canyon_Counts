Get data and start looking at them:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
source("Granite_Canyon_Counts_fcns.R")

YEAR <- 2020
obs.list <- read.csv("Data/Observer list.csv", header = T) 
colnames(obs.list) <- c("obs", "ID")

difs.list <- compare.V0.V2.raw(YEAR, obs.list)

```


There were 3 differences. 

```{r}
idx <- 1
difs.list$difs.1[idx,]
```

Two less periods and 35 less whales in V0 than in V2!

```{r}
difs.list$FinalData.Both %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) %>% 
  filter(v == "V0") -> tmp.V0

difs.list$FinalData.Both %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) %>% 
  filter(v == "V2") -> tmp.V2

# Nothing returned from V0

difs.list$Data_Out.v2 %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) 

FF <- 34
data <- get.data("Data/", YEAR, ff = FF)

shift <- 1
out.shift.1 <- get.shift(YEAR, data, ff = FF, i = shift)

shift <- 2
out.shift.2 <- get.shift(YEAR, data, ff = FF, i = shift)

# I believe it has to do with extensive comments... 

```


```{r}
idx <- 2
difs.list$difs.1[idx,]
```

1 less period and 12 less whales in V0 than in V2 (fixing the data file change
this to 13 whales, then to 14)

```{r}

difs.list$FinalData.Both %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) %>% 
  filter(v == "V0") -> tmp.V0

difs.list$FinalData.Both %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) %>% 
  filter(v == "V2") -> tmp.V2

# the sixth period with 14 whales were not returned from V0

difs.list$Data_Out.v2 %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) 

FF <- 36
data <- get.data("Data/", YEAR, ff = FF)

shift <- 6
out.shift.6 <- get.shift(YEAR, data, ff=FF, i=shift)

# There was no E entry at the end of the file, which might have caused a problem
# in V0 extraction script. That has been fixed. But... sightings 65 and 66 were
# not picked up probably because data were not entered correctly. Needed to edit 
# the data file. _TE added to the file name. 2022-03-21 (There may be another 
# version on the other computer... make sure they are equivalent!)

out.shift.6$data %>% group_by(V5) %>%
  mutate(V9 = as.numeric(V9)) %>%
  summarize(n = last(V9)) -> summary.6
  
sum(summary.6$n)  

# There were 12 whales in there. (now 13 then 14)

data %>%  
  filter(begin >= tmp.V2[6,"begin"] & begin <= tmp.V2[6, "end"]) %>% 
  filter(V2 == "S") %>% 
  select(V5, V9) %>% 
  mutate(V5 = as.numeric(V5), V9 = as.numeric(V9)) %>% 
  group_by(V5) %>% 
  summarize(n = last(V9)) 


```


```{r}
idx <- 3
difs.list$difs.1[idx,]
```

1 less period and 14 less whales in V0 than in V2. Now 14 whales after fixing missing BF and VS entries.

```{r}

difs.list$FinalData.Both %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) %>% 
  filter(v == "V0") -> tmp.V0

difs.list$FinalData.Both %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) %>% 
  filter(v == "V2") -> tmp.V2

# tmp.V0 shows that there were at least 8 shifts for the day. Looking at the 
# number of whales between V0 and V2, shifts don't match between V0 and V2.

v0.correct.length <- difs.list$v0.out$CorrectLength
v0.all.data <- difs.list$v0.out$Data_Out

difs.list$Data_Out.v2 %>% 
  filter(time.steps == difs.list$difs.1[idx, "time.step"]) -> Data_Out.v2.tmp

FF <- Data_Out.v2.tmp[1, "ff"]
data <- get.data("Data/", YEAR, ff = FF)

V0.FF <- v0.all.data %>% filter(ff == FF)

# Looking at V0.FF, i = 2 in V0 shows there was no data for that shift.
data %>%  
  filter(begin >= V0.FF[2,"begin"] & begin <= V0.FF[2, "end"]) -> data.FF.i
# there were only two lines: V and E, which should have been part of the 
# first shift. 

# in Vers2.0
out.shift.1 <- get.shift(YEAR, data, ff=FF, i=1)
# The last two lines match with the 2nd shift from Ver1.0

# The difference was caused by Ver1.0 dropping the 4th shift, where Bft and VS
# were NAs.

out.shift.4 <- get.shift(YEAR, data, ff=FF, i=4)

# 2020-01-28, 
# There were 7 shifts. Shifts 5, 6, and 7 are the same as shifts 1, 2 and 3 in 
# V0. Shift 4 is missing from V0. The first three shifts were too short to be
# included in analysis. 

# Data were entered incorrectly for groups 12, 13, 14, and 15. This was also 
# fixed in the _TE file. No BF and VS entries. 


```


NEED TO FIX GET.DATA FUNCTION TO INCLUDE SECONDS IN TIME. 2022-03-17
This has been completed.
