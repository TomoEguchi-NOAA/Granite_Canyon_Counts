In this version, I use the new function that was used to compare Josh's and my results. 

This fix may work for all years. At least, 2015 and 2016 files were processed without any errors. Results need to be compared with Josh's outputs. 


The station information needs to be added. The data files that I have don't have that info... this needs to be fixed in the future. 


```{r}

# Do not run 2023 with this script. Use Extract_Data_2023.Rmd for 2023. 
# I ran 2023 data and seemed to work fine... 2023-10-19
# YEAR should be one of 2015, 2016, 2020, 2022, 2023 (and beyond)
YEAR <- 2020 #Enter the year of the data files

# For 2010 and 2011 (maybe in the previous years too but I don't have any of those files)
# Time is entered in decimal hours, not hh:mm:ss. So, that needs to be accommodated in
# data extraction code. 2022-10-05

```
