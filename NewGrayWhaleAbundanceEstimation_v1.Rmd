## Introduction {.unnumbered}

The Eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whale (*Eschrichtius robustus*) population undertakes one of the longest annual migrations of any mammal, traveling between its Arctic feeding grounds and the warm-water lagoons of Baja California, Mexico, where they calve and breed. This iconic population has been the subject of extensive research due to its remarkable recovery from historic whaling and its continued vulnerability to environmental changes and anthropogenic impacts. Understanding the dynamics of the ENP gray whale population, including its abundance, distribution, and migratory patterns, is crucial for effective conservation and management.

Analytical methods to estimate the abundance of gray whales from visual surveys at Granite Canyon, CA, have evolved over the years [@laake_gray_2012; @durban_estimating_2015]. Laake et al. (2012) used the distance sampling approach with generalized additive models (GAMs). Durban et al. (2015) developed a new method using a Bayesian N-mixture approach, which was approved by the International Whaling Commission (IWC), and it has been used for the analysis since the 2015/2016 season. In their approach, Durban et al. used the observed changes in migrating gray whales at a single location along the migration corridor. The general trend of migration is that the number of gray whale sightings increases over time, reaches a peak, and then decreases. Durban et al.’s method used the Gaussian function to capture this general trend, while deviations from the Gaussian function were modeled via fitting a spline function to the observed counts. The analysis was conducted using WinBUGS, which had become largely obsolete over the past decade.

This report presents improvements to the method developed by Durban et al. I will first briefly describe the method by Durban et al. and identify its underlying assumptions. Then, I will introduce a new approach that is consistent with the foundational concepts of the Durban et al. method but improves upon it by replacing the Gaussian/spline model with a single, more flexible function. Finally, I reanalyze the data from Granite Canyon, CA, to compare abundance estimates among the three approaches: Laake et al. (2012), Durban et al. (2015), and the new approach presented here.

### Method by Durban et al. (2015) {.unnumbered}

To estimate the detectability of gray whales by visual observers at the field station located at Granite Canyon, CA, counts from two independent stations of paired observers operating simultaneously were compared during two seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011). The two watch stations were positioned 35 m apart at the same elevation (22.5 m) above sea level (Durban et al. 2015). For the years with only one station, the detectability was extrapolated for all monitored watch periods based on the fitted model for the detectability, where the counts for the south watch station were treated as zero inflated binomial outcomes. The binomial probability was specified as the product of an indicator function and the detectability ($u_{i,j,t} \times p_{i,j,t}$), where $u$ = 1 or 0 to indicate whether or not count data were collected from that station, respectively. This formulation ensured that structural zero counts from periods without a second watch did not contribute to the likelihood for estimation of $p$ or $N$ (Durban et al. 2015).

Consistent with Laake et al. (2012), the model for the detection probability incorporated fixed effects for visibility ($VS$) and the Beaufort sea state ($BF$), whereas observers were treated as random effects ($O$). These were modeled as additive effects on a general intercept so that the direction and magnitude of the estimated effects away from zero (no effect) could be assessed. The selection for the inclusion of these effects was accomplished by using Bayesian model selection with stochastic binary indicator variables $I$ to switch each of the three possible effects (i.e., $V$, $B$, and $O$) either in or out of the model:

\begin{equation}
logit(p_{i,d(j),t}) = logit(p_0) + I_{V} \beta_{V} V_{d(j),t} + I_{B} \beta_{B} B_{d(j),t}+ I_{O} \mathbf{\beta}^{O_{i,d(j),t} = o}_{O} (\#eq:detection-probability-Durban)
\end{equation}

where the intercept $p_0$ was the base detection probability in the absence of covariate effects, assigned a Uniform(0,1) prior distribution, and $logit(p_0) = ln(p_0/(1–p_0))$. For each fixed effect, $\beta_{B}$ and $\beta_{V}$, a Normal prior distribution with mean zero and standard deviation of 10 was used. The random effect for each observer was drawn from a Normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma_{O} \sim Uniform(0,10)$. Each binary indicator variable, $I$, was assigned a Bernoulli(0.5) distribution to specify equal probability of inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of the effect in the model (Durban et al. 2015).

Observation probability, then, was computed by multiplying the detection probability with an indicator function for whether or not an observer was present ($u$):

$$ obs.prob = u \times p $$

Coefficients were computed separately for the normal and spline functions, where one or the other was selected based on which function was deemed appropriate for each day.

A mathematical description of the approach by Durban et al. is provided in the Appendix.

### Limitations of the Durban et al method {.unnumbered}

Durban et al. (2015) used the "cut" function within WinBUGS to dissociate estimated parameters between the "Common" ($f_{d,t}$) and "Specific" ($g_{d,t}$) models. The function (*cut*) is unavailable in modern Bayesian computation packages (e.g., JAGS, STAN) and its use has been questioned [@plummer_cuts_2015]. In short, the "cut" function does not converge to a well-defined limiting distribution (Plummer 2015). Furthermore, the assumption that the number of migrating gray whales in front of an observation station follows a Gaussian distribution centered around the midpoint of the season is a potential limitation. The actual migration curve may not be symmetric, and the peak abundance may persist for several days rather than being instantaneous. While fitting spline functions to observed counts may alleviate some of these problems, a fitted spline can be overly flexible. A spline fit can fail to preserve the general migration assumption that the number of whales increases from the beginning of a migration season, reaches a peak, and then decreases toward the end of the season. Additionally, the Durban et al. method implicitly assumed that two observation stations operated simultaneously with identical effort. In reality, however, watch durations were not always identical between the two stations in previous years.

## Methods {.unnumbered}

### Data {.unnumbered}

A series of modifications were made from the 1967/1968 to 2006/2007 seasons (Laake et al. 2012). starting in the 2010/2011 season, further modifications were employed where a computer was used to predict movements of gray whale pods, thereby increasing the chance of repeatedly observing the same pods to determine the number of individuals in each pod accurately. In Durban et al. (2015), they treated the data from previous years as not compatible in their analysis. Consequently, the subsequent analysis to estimate gray whale abundance used the data since the 2006/2007 season (e.g., Stewart and Weller 2021, Eguchi et al., 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025). Since the 2010/2011 season, no dual-observer survey has been conducted to estimate detection probability due to the logistical and financial constraints. Consequently, the data from the two seasons (i.e., 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons) are the primary source of information for estimating detection probabilities. Prior to the 2006/2007 season, two observation stations were present in several years. In those years, sightings of the same pods by two teams were used to estimate detection probabilities via the "capture-recapture" method. These sightings data can be used in the N-mixture framework by retaining the number of observed pods but disregarding the pod identity. In this paper, I used all the data from the 1967/1968 season by using statistical models that can accommodate differing survey durations.

### New Modeling Approach {.unnumbered}

A primary limitation of using a spline in the Durban et al. approach was the difficulty in handling missing data points (e.g., weekends, seasons with fewer than 90 observation days, and short survey shifts due to inclement conditions). To address this and other limitations, I propose a new approach that replaces the Gaussian distribution and spline functions with a single flexible function.

This new approach uses a function that can accommodate an asymmetrical shape around the peak, while reflecting the general pattern of increase, peak, and decrease in whale counts. This pattern can be modeled with the product of two sigmoid equations or mathematical functions that have a peak that is not necessarily centered. A similar pattern is often found in nesting marine turtles. For instance, a model derived from a modified Verhulst equation was used to describe the number of leatherback turtles in French Guiana and Suriname [@girondot_modeling_2007]. The equation is similar to the Richards growth function [@richards1959] and has the following form.

$$M_1 = (1 + (2 e^K - 1) * e^{(P_1-d)/(-S_1)}) ^ {(-1/e^K)}$$

$$M_2 = (1 + (2 e^K - 1) * e^{(P_2-d)/S_2}) ^ {(-1/e^K)}$$

$$N = N_{min} + (N_{max} - N_{min}) * (M_1 * M_2),$$

where $d > 0$ is the number of days since an arbitrary start date, $S_1 > 0$ and $S_2 > 0$ define how the slope decreases and increases, respectively, $K > 0$ defines the "flatness" at the peak of the function, $P_1$ and $P_2$ define where the peak is relative to the range of $d$, where $min(d) < P_1 <= P_2 < max(d)$, $N_{min}$ is the number of whales migrating outside of a migration season ($N_{min} = 0$), and $N_{max} >> N_{min}$. $N_{max}$ is not the maximum number of whales migrating per day, but it is a parameter that may be fixed or estimated during the analysis. Effects of these parameters on the shape of the equation are described in the Appendix. Hereafter, this function will be referred to as the Richards equation.

I created eight versions of the Richards equation, based on how $P_1$, $P_2$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ were defined with respect to time (Table \@ref(tab:model-definition)). The $N_{max}$ parameter was assumed to be year-specific and $K$ was assumed to be constant across all years. Each parameter had a hyper-distribution of either a Gaussian, uniform, or gamma distribution. Uniform distributions were used for the prior distributions of hyperparameters (Appendix Table \@ref(tab:hyperparameter-table)).

                         P2 = c(rep("Year", 4), rep("P[Year]", 4)),
                         S1 = rep(c("Year", "Constant"), 4),
                         S2 = rep(c("Year", "Constant", "Constant", "Year"), 2))

The Richards equation provided the daily mean number of gray whales passing through the observation point. Following the methodology of Durban et al., a Poisson distribution was used to model the daily count of whales passing the observation point:

$$ N_{t, y} \sim POI(\bar{N}_{t,y}) $$

where $\bar{N}_{t,y}$ is the expected number of whales that migrate through the sampling area on the day $t$ of the season $y$, which is modeled with the Richards equation. The observation probability ($p_{i_t, s, y}$) was a function of the viewing conditions (the Beaufort sea state ($B$) and visibility code ($V$)), the overall mean probability of detection ($\beta_0$), observer random effects ($O$), and a watch duration offset ($L$). The watch duration offset was included to accommodate differing durations of observation shifts due to changes in survey protocols and inclement conditions. For the observer random effects, individuals with fewer than 10 sightings were pooled into a single “observer” category, as their limited data were not sufficient for use as a distinct random effect.

\begin{equation}
logit(p_{i_t, s, y}) = \beta_0 + \beta_{B} \times B_{i_t, y} + \beta_{V} \times V_{i_t, y} + O_{i_t, s, y} + log(L_{i_t, y}) (\#eq:detection-probability)
\end{equation}

where the index $i_t$ is the watch period $i$ of the day $t$, $s$ is the station (1 or 2), and $y$ is the season. The intercept ($\beta_0$) in the new approach \@ref(eq:detection-probability) can be expressed in terms of the intercept ($p_0$) of the Durban et al. approach \@ref(eq:detection-probability-Durban) via the logit function:

$$ \beta_0 = ln(p_0/(1 - p_0)) $$

Similar to the approach taken by Durban et al., the binomial model was employed to approximate the sampling process:

$$ n_{i_t,s,y} \sim BIN(N_{t, y}, p_{i_t, s, y}) $$

where $n_{i_t, s, y}$ is the observed number of gray whales during the watch period $i$ of the $t$-th day of the season $y$ from the station $s$. The total number of gray whales for the season $y$ is the sum of all $N_{t, y}$ and corrected for nighttime passage:

$$ N_y = \lambda * \sum_{t = 1} ^ {max(d)} N_{t, y} $$ and

$$ \lambda \sim N(1.0875, 0.03625) $$ (Perryman et al. 1999).

In the Durban et al. analysis, the annual migration at the survey station was defined as a 90-day period starting on December 1, with the number of passing whales assumed to be zero on days 1 and 90 (February 29th or March 1st). However, in some years, observations continued beyond March 1st. To incorporate all available data, I defined the annual migration period as 100 days (ending on March 10th or 11th), assuming the number of passing whales was zero on days 1 and 100 ($max(d) = 100$).

The new approach was used to analyze the entire dataset from the 1967/1968 season onward, and the results were compared to the estimates reported in Eguchi et al. (2025). In order to apply the new approach to historical data, sighting data between the 1967/1968 and 2006/2007 seasons were obtained from the ERAnalysis package (<https://github.com/jlaake/ERAnalysis>, Laake 2012). An R script was written to convert the sightings data in the package to an input object required for the new analysis. Data from the 2007/2008 season to the 2024/2025 season were extracted from raw data files using another R script. All shifts of at least 60 minutes with the Beaufort sea state of \< 5 and the visibility code of \< 5 were included in the analysis. Laake et al.’s approach was applied to the entire dataset after formatting new data from the 2007/2008 season into the input object for Laake et al.’s approach. Because no information was available to match sightings of pods between the two stations in the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons, only "naive" estimates in Laake et al.'s approach were computed.

The new models were fitted to the data using JAGS (Plummer) in the R statistical environment, using the *jagsUI* package (Kellner 2024). For each model, five MCMC chains were run for 550,000 steps each. The first 500,000 samples of each chain were discarded as “burn-in.” The remaining posterior samples were thinned by taking every 100 samples, resulting in 2500 posterior samples for inference. The convergence of MCMC was assessed using the rank-normalized R-hat statistic [@vehtari2021]. Goodness-of-fit was determined via Pareto-k statistics [@vehtari_practical_2017] via the *loo* package (Vehtari et al. 2024). The performance of models were compared using the LOOIC (Leave-One-Out Information Criteria) statistic via the *loo* and *rstanarm* (Goodrich et al. 2024) packages.

To compare the three approaches (Laake et al., Durban et al., and the new approach), I fitted generalized additive models (GAMs) to point abundance estimates between the 2006/2007 and 2024/2025 seasons. The rate of recent decline in the estimated abundance was compared by fitting linear models to the point estimates between the 2015/2016 and 2024/2025 seasons.

JAGS models and R scripts to conduct the analysis, including data extraction and executing the JAGS models, and data are available at the GitHub repository ().

The eight models were fitted to the sightings data over 32 seasons. Based on LOOIC, Model `r out.table$model[1]` was identified as the best-fitting model (Table \@ref(tab:model-table)). Although Model `r model.ID[which(prop.big.Rhat == min(prop.big.Rhat))]` had the lowest proportion of the monitored parameters with the R-hat statistics \> 1.01 (Table \@ref(tab:model-table)), after visual inspection of trace plots for parameters of Model `r out.table$model[1]` with high Rhat statistics (Appendix Figures \@ref(fig:Figure-trace-1), \@ref(fig:Figure-trace-2), and \@ref(fig:Figure-trace-3)), I concluded that Model `r out.table$model[1]` was the most appropriate for inference. The model consists of year-specific $P$ ($P_1 = P_2$), $S_1$, and $S_2$ parameters (Table \@ref(tab:model-definitions)).

# The sightings files are split into Primary observer and Secondary observer sightings.
# Primary observer sightings are whales that are not travelling North and are defined by
# those when EXPERIMENT==1 (single observer) or a designated LOCATION when EXPERIMENT==2.
#  For surveys 2000/2001 and 2001/2002, the primary observer was at LOCATION=="N"
# and for all other years, LOCATION=="S".
#
# Based on the projected timing of the passage of the whale (t241) perpendicular to the 
# watch station, the sighting was either contained in the watch (on effort) or not (off effort).
# The dataframe Primary contains all of the on effort sightings and PrimaryOff contains all
# of the off-effort sightings.  The code below shows that the counts of primary
# sighting records matches the total counts of the on and off effort sightings split into

For the Durban et al. and new approaches, medians of the posterior distributions were used as the point estimates, whereas for the Laake et al. approach, it was the maximum likelihood estimates. Estimated abundances from the new approach generally followed the same trend as the previous approaches, with a few notable differences (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-N-hats)). For the majority of estimates, the Laake et al. and the new approaches provided almost identical estimates, and the 95% credible and confidence intervals overlapped significantly. The new and Laake et al. approaches produced lower estimates than the Durban et al. approach in all but one year among the 11 years when all three estimates were available.

GAMs fitted to the estimated abundance between the 2006/2007 and 2024/2025 seasons indicated that all three approaches provided comparable results regarding the general trend, with a main difference at the beginning of the timeseries (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-gam-fits)). For the 2006/2007 season, the estimated abundance with the new approach was notably lower than that from the other two methods (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-N-hats)). Even with this difference, however, estimated intercepts (the averages of abundance estimates) between the new (`r format(coef(gam.2006.Eguchi)["(Intercept)"], scientific = F)` $\pm$ `r signif(summary.gam(gam.2006.Eguchi)$se["(Intercept)"], 4)`) and the Laake et al. approach (`r format(coef(gam.2006.Laake)["(Intercept)"], scientific = F)` $\pm$ `r signif(summary.gam(gam.2006.Laake)$se["(Intercept)"], 4)`) were not significantly different, whereas the Durban approach was significantly greater (`r format(coef(gam.2006.Durban)["(Intercept)"], scientific = F)` $\pm$ `r signif(summary.gam(gam.2006.Durban)$se["(Intercept)"], 4)`) than the other two approaches. Over the entire timeseries from the 1967/1968 season, the estimated intercepts were similar between the two approaches (Laake: `r format(coef(gam.all.Laake)["(Intercept)"], scientific = F)` $\pm$ `r signif(summary.gam(gam.all.Laake)$se["(Intercept)"], 4)`, Eguchi: `r format(coef(gam.all.Eguchi)["(Intercept)"], scientific = F)` $\pm$ `r signif(summary.gam(gam.all.Eguchi)$se["(Intercept)"], 4)`)

For general linear models ($log(\hat{N}) = time + \epsilon$) fitted to the point estimates from the 2014/2015 season to the 2024/2025 season revealed a statistically indistinguishable annual rate of decline among the three approaches (Laake: `r signif(lm.Laake$coefficients[2],1)` $\pm$ `r signif(coef(summary(lm.Laake))["time", "Std. Error"], 2)`. Durban: `r signif(lm.Durban$coefficients[2],1)` $\pm$ `r signif(coef(summary(lm.Durban))["time", "Std.

The base detection probability ($\beta_0$) was significantly lower for the new approach (mean = `r signif(mean.p.0, 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(p.0.CLs[1], 3)` - `r signif(p.0.CLs[2], 3)`]) than in Durban et al. (0.80, 95% Highest Posterior Density Interval = 0.75-0.85). As expected, the fixed effect of the visibility code on observation probability was negative (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-Fixed-posteriors)), indicating that less favorable conditions resulted in lower detection probabilities. Perplexingly, the fixed effect of the Beaufort sea state was positive (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-Fixed-posteriors)), suggesting that higher Beaufort sea states corresponded with greater detection probabilities. One possible explanation is that observers may have detected more singletons at low sea states, whereas only large groups were sighted at high sea states. The observer random effects indicated significant differences among individuals, consistent with the findings of Durban et al. (Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-observers)).

Posterior distributions of the Richards equation parameters provided valuable insights into how annual gray whale migration varied among years. The $P$ parameters, which define the timing of the migration peak, shifted over the years (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-P-posteriors)), a phenomenon reported in previous studies ([@rugh_timing_2001], Eguchi et al. 2023, 2024, 2025), although the significance and causes for the change are unknown. The $S_1$ and $S_2$ parameters, which define the width of the migration curve, also varied annually, indicating that the duration of migration fluctuated from year to year (Appendix Figures \@ref(fig:Figure-S1-posteriors) and \@ref(fig:Figure-S2-posteriors)).

## Discussion {.unnumbered}

The new modeling approach yielded results comparable to those obtained by the methods of Laake et al. and Durban et al. Although point estimates were different in some years, the confidence and credible intervals overlapped in most of the time series, and all three methods captured similar long-term trends and the recent rate of decline.

The new approach offers several advantages over the method of Durban et al. First, it eliminates the use of the “cut” function, which has been identified as statistically inappropriate (Plummer 2015). Second, the model is coded in JAGS, a more contemporary and widely used Bayesian modeling language. The new model in JAGS runs significantly faster than Durban et al.'s model in WinBUGS. The analysis of the entire 32-year dataset took approximately `r signif(jm.out$Run_Time, 2)` hrs per model with the new approach, compared to `r signif(WinBugs.out$Run_Time, 3)` hours for an 11-year analysis using WinBUGS. Third, the new framework allows for formal model selection and goodness-of-fit assessment using modern criteria, such as LOOIC and the Pareto-k statistic, which were not part of the original Durban et al. analysis. Fourth, while retaining the N-mixture modeling framework, the new approach is more straightforward in its implementation.

Examination of Pareto-k statistics indicated that high Pareto-k values coincided with extreme data points, where counts were unusually high or low compared to adjacent shifts (Appendix Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-pareto-k)). While statistically notable, these fluctuations are consistent with the known patterns of gray whale migration. Therefore, I concluded that the model, i.e., combining the Richards equation and the N-mixture framework, was appropriate for analyzing the entire dataset.

The new approach is also adaptable and can incorporate additional information as it becomes available. For example, data from uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) are being used to estimate precision and bias in group size estimates made by visual observers. If correction functions can be derived from these UAS data, conditional on observed group sizes, they could be used to adjust the group size of each sighting. Finally, this abundance estimation model could be incorporated into a more comprehensive population model, such as the one developed by [@stewart_boom-bust_2023].

In summary, the new approach provides a simpler, faster, and more statistically robust algorithm for estimating the abundance of gray whales from the long-term visual surveys conducted at Granite Canyon, CA, while producing results that are consistent with those of previous methods.

## Appendix {.unnumbered}

### Mathematical description of Durban's approach {.unnumbered}

This section was extracted from Durban et al. (2015), almost verbatim. I edited some places to make explanations clearer and changed some symbols to make them consistent between theirs and the new approach.

The total counts of whales ($n_{i,d(j),t}$) during the watch period $j$ of the $d$th day in the year $t$ at the watch station $i$ was modeled as a binomial random deviate (in the paper, $j$ was not specified as the $j$th watch period during the $d$th day of the season):

$$ n_{i,d(j),t} \sim BIN(N_{d(j),t}, p_{i,d(j),t}). $$

The binomial $N_{d(j),t}$ parameter is the unknown total number of gray whales passing through the study area during the watch period $j$ in the $d$th day in the year $t$.

The detection probability was modeled as a function of visibility (V), Beaufort scale (B), and observers (O).

$$ logit(p_{i,d(j),t}) = logit(p_0) + I_{V} \beta_{V} V_{d(j),t} + I_{B} \beta_{B} B_{d(j),t}+ I_{O} \mathbf{\beta}^{O_{i,d(j),t} = o}_{O} $$

where the intercept $p_0$ was the base detection probability in the absence of covariate effects, assigned a Uniform(0,1) prior distribution, and $logit(p_0) = ln(p_0/(1–p_0))$. For each fixed effect, $\beta_{B}$ and $\beta_{V}$, a Normal prior distribution with mean zero and standard deviation of 10 was used. The random effect for each observer was drawn from a Normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma_{O} \sim Uniform(0,10)$. Each binary indicator variable, I, was assigned a Bernoulli(0.5) distribution to specify equal probability of inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of the effect in the model (Durban et al. 2015).

A Poisson distribution ($N_{d(j),t} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{d(j),t})$) was used as a hierarchical prior for the distribution of abundances, and specified a model for the Poisson mean ($\lambda$) in terms of the number of whales passing each day ($d$), with an offset for the effort duration of each watch period, $E_{d(j),t}$ in decimal days (Laake et al., 2012):

$$ log(\lambda_{d(j),t}) = log(E_{d(j),t}) + model_{d,t}$$

$$ model_{d,t} = z_{d,t} f_{d,t} + (1 – z_{d,t}) g_{d,t} $$

where $z_{d,t}$ is an indicator function (see below). $f_{d,t}$ and $g_{d,t}$ are also explained below.

Days were specified as d = 0 to 90, where days were counted from 12:00 a.m. on 1 December, and we added an abundance of 0 whales passing for day 0 and 90 to anchor the fitted model when we assumed whales did not pass (Buckland et al. 1993).

Estimates were derived from either of two competing models ['Common' ($f$) and 'Specific' ($g$), e.g., [@li_baystdetect_2012] describing changes in abundance across each annual migration. The model contributing each daily estimate was indicated using stochastic binary indicator variables $z_{d,t}$, each assigned a Bernoulli(0.5) prior distribution. As such, the posterior distribution of each $z_{d,t}$ indicated the probability of a daily estimate conforming to the common trend, allowing flexibility for departures from this trend that may only exist on certain days in certain years to be identified and modeled (rather than assuming all counts from an entire year conform to or depart from a common trend). The total number of whales passing at the survey location during each migration was then estimated by summing the expected value from the model averaged number of whales passing each day ($d$) from 0 to 90 (Laake et al., 2012).

These estimates were then rescaled to account for the differential passage rate at night [@perryman_diel_1999], based on the nine hour day multiplicative correction factor [@rugh_estimates_2005]. Specifically, we applied a constant night time correction factor that was assumed to be a Normally distributed fixed effect with mean of 1.0875 and standard deviation of 0.037 [@perryman_diel_1999].

For the 'Common model' ($f_{d,t}$), we assumed a typical trend in abundance throughout each annual migration (e.g. Buckland et al., 1993), with abundance changes assumed Normally distributed around a migration mid-point. A Normal distribution was specified as a quadratic function of days, on the log scale:

$$f_{d,t} = a_t + b_t *d_t + c_t * d^2_t$$

where the mid-point of the migration curve for each year $t$ was derived by $–b_t/2a_t$. This assumed common migration curve allowed information to be 'borrowed' across years when needed, specifying association across years to strengthen inference about migration curves in years with relatively sparse counts. Each parameter was specified to be drawn from a hierarchical Normal distribution.

$$ a_t \sim Normal(\mu_a, \sigma_a)$$

$$ b_t \sim Normal(\mu_b, \sigma_b)$$

$$ c_t \sim Normal(\mu_c, \sigma_c)$$

and $\mu \sim Normal(0, 10)$ and $\sigma \sim Uniform(0, 10)$, for $a$, $b$, and $c$.

This hierarchical and random effects approach allowed the timing, level and extent of the Normal migration curve to vary annually around the general pattern, if supported by the data.

To acknowledge and incorporate deviations from the common Normal model, the selection of an alternative 'specific' migration model was allowed ($g_{d,t}$). The 'specific' model was a semi-parametric model that estimated the time trends independently for each year without making any prior assumptions about its form (e.g., Laake et al., 2012). In this model, the shape of the relationship of true abundance across days was determined by the data via penalized splines [@ruppert_selecting_2002].

A linear (on the log scale) penalized spline was used to describe this relationship [@crainiceanu_bayesian_2005]:

$$ g_{d,t} = S_{0,t} + S_{1,t} * d_t + \sum_{k=1}^{m} \lambda_{k,t} (d_t – \kappa_{k,t}) $$ Where $S_{0,t}, S_{1,t}$ and $\lambda_{1,t}, \dots, \lambda_{m,t}$ were regression coefficients to be estimated separately for each year and $\kappa_{1,t} < \kappa_{2,t} < \dots < \kappa_{m,t}$ were fixed knots. To ensure the desired flexibility, we used m = 15 knots, which is a relatively large number. To avoid overfitting, the $\lambda$'s were penalized by assuming that they were Normally distributed random variables with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sim Uniform(0,10)$. The parameters $S_{0,t}, S_{1,t}$ were modeled as fixed effects with Normal(0, 10) prior distributions.

### Characteristics of Richards equation {.unnumbered}

#### Effects of $S_1$ {.unnumbered}

The parameter $S_1$ defines how the curve decreases from its peak. The rate of decline slows down as $S_1$ becomes greater (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-S1)). Because we make an assumption that there are no whales migrating after day 100 (or any other assumed "end" day), the lower bound of $S_1$ can be restricted to a certain value, (e.g., $0 < S_1 < 5$).

The parameter $S_20$ defines how the curve increases to its peak. The rate of increase slows down as $S_2$ becomes larger (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-S2)). Because we make an assumption that there are no whales migrating before day 1, the upper bound of $S_2$ can be restricted to a certain value (e.g., $0 < S_2 < 5$).

```{r S2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
S1 <- 1.5
S2 <- c(0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.5, 5, 10)
K <- 1
P <- 40
max.N <- 800

true.mean.N <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 90, ncol = length(S2))

for (c in 1:length(S2)){
  for (d in 1:90){
    true.mean.N[d, c] <- floor(Richards_fcn(d = d, 
                                            S1 = -S1, 
                                            S2 = S2[c],
                                            K = K, 
                                            P = P, 
                                            min = 0, max = max.N)  )
    
  }
  
}

data.df <- data.frame(Day = rep(1:90, times = length(S2)),
                      mean.N = as.vector(true.mean.N),

                      S2 = rep(S2, each = 90))

p.S2 <- ggplot(data = data.df) +
  geom_path(aes(x = Day, y = mean.N), color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ S2) +
  ylab("")

save.fig.fcn(p.S2,

             height = 5, width = 7,replace = T, dpi = dpi.set)

knitr::include_graphics(paste0("figures/S2_", dpi.set, "dpi.png"))

```

#### Effects of K {.unnumbered}

The parameter $K > 0$ defines the flatness of the curve at its peak. Greater $K$ values correspond to flatter peaks (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-K)). Similarly to $S_1$ and $S_2$, the upper bound of $K$ may be defined based on the assumption that the numbers of migrating gray whales are zero at day 1 and 100 (e.g., $0 < K < max(K)$). The upper bound ($max(K)$) may change when other parameters change, such as $S_1$ and $S_2$.

```{r K, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
S1 <- 2.5
S2 <- 2.5
K <- c(0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 4, 8)
P <- 40
max.N <- 800

true.mean.N <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 90, 
                           ncol = length(K))

for (c in 1:length(K)){
  for (d in 1:90){
    true.mean.N[d, c] <- floor(Richards_fcn(d = d, 
                                            S1 = -S1, 
                                            S2 = S2,
                                            K = K[c], 
                                            P = P, 
                                            min = 0, max = max.N)  )
    
  }

#### Effects of P {.unnumbered}

The parameter $P$ defines the location of its peak (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-P)).

```{r P, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
S1 <- 2.5

K <- 1.5
P <- c(20, 40, 60, 80)

true.mean.N <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 90, 
                           ncol = length(P))

for (c in 1:length(P)){
  for (d in 1:90){
    true.mean.N[d, c] <- floor(Richards_fcn(d = d,
