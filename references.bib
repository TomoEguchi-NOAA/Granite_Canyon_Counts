	title = {Gray whale southbound migration surveys 1967–2006: an integrated re-analysis},
	abstract = {Between 1967 and 2007, 23 seasons of shore-based counts of the Eastern North Pacific (ENP) stock of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) were conducted throughout all or most of the southbound migration near Carmel, California. Population estimates have been derived from these surveys using a variety of techniques that were adapted as the data collection protocol evolved. The subsequent time series of estimates was used to evaluate trend and population status, resulting in the conclusion that the population was no longer endangered and had achieved its optimum sustainable population (OSP) level. We re-evaluated the data from all of the surveys using a common estimation procedure and an improved method for treatment of error in pod size and detection probability estimation. The newly derived abundance estimates between 1967 and 1987 were generally larger (–2.5\% to 21\%) than previous abundance estimates. However, the opposite was the case for survey years 1992 to 2006, with estimates declining from –4.9\% to –29\%. This pattern is largely explained by the differences in the correction for pod size bias, which occurred because the pod sizes in the calibration data over-represented pods of two or more whales and underrepresented single whales relative to the estimated true pod size distribution.},

	abstract = {Nesting of leatherbacks in French Guiana and Suriname has been monitored for more than 30 years. Given the documented exchange of tagged females across the nesting beaches, leatherbacks found on the 6 principal nesting areas in French Guiana and Suriname are considered to be a single large nesting population. Despite more than 3 decades of work on this population, this population’s status remains unclear. Here we describe the most recently available estimates of various life history parameters and describe the trend of the number of nests laid in the region over the past 36 years. Our analyses suggest that the trend of the whole population in French Guiana and Suriname is stable or slightly increasing over this time period. We strongly urge the continued monitoring of the population by the different research groups in the region so that future data sets will enable an accurate description of the status of this leatherback population.},

	title = {Estimating gray whale abundance from shore-based counts using a multilevel {Bayesian} model},
	abstract = {Counts of southbound migrating whales off California form the basis of abundance estimation for the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Previous assessments (1967–2007) have estimated detection probability (p) from the detection-non detection of pods by two independent observers. However, tracking distinct pods in the field can be difficult for single observers; resulting in biased estimates of pod sizes that needed correcting, and matching observations of the same pod by both observers involved key assumptions. Due to these limitations, a new observation approach has been adopted wherein a paired team of observers work together and use a computerised mapping application to better track and enumerate distinct pods and tally the number of whales passing during watch periods. This approach has produced consistent counts over four recently monitored migrations (2006/7, 2007/8, 2009/10 and 2010/11), with an apparent increase in p compared to the previous method. To evaluate p and estimate abundance in these four years, counts from two independent stations of paired observers operating simultaneously were compared using a hierarchical Bayesian ‘N-mixture’ model to jointly estimate p and abundance without the challenge of matching pods between stations. The baseline detectability powas estimated as 0.80 (95\% Highest Posterior Density Interval [HPDI] = 0.75–0.85), which varied with observation conditions, observer effects and changes in whale abundance during the migration. Abundance changes were described using Bayesian model selection between a parametric model for a normally distributed common migration trend and a semi-parametric model that estimated the time trends independently for each year; the resultant migration curve was a weighted compromise between models, allowing for key departures from the common trend. The summed estimates of migration abundance ranged from 17,820 (95\% HPDI = 16,150–19,920) in 2007/08 to 21,210 (95\% HPDI = 19,420–23,230) in 2009/10, consistent with previous estimates and indicative of a stable population.},

@article{rugh_timing_2001,
	title = {Timing of the gray whale southbound migration},
	abstract = {The southbound migration of the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) has been documented by the National Marine Fisheries Service most seasons since 1967 at or near Granite Canyon, in central California, and by the American Cetacean Society’s Los Angeles Chapter every season since 1985 at Point Vicente, southern California. This has provided a rare opportunity to examine cetacean migratory timing data over a relatively long time series. In 1998/99, anecdotal reports indicated a major change had occurred in the timing of the migration, which prompted this study to compare the observed timing relative to expected dates. Although no observers were at Granite Canyon in 1998/99, data collected from this site indicated that prior to 1980, annual median sighting dates ranged from 4-13 January (overall median = 8 January; CI = 1.3), but since then there has been a one-week (6.8 day; CI = 2.0) delay, with median dates now ranging from 12-18 January (overall median = 15 January; CI = 1.7). This delay in timing is better represented as a shift in dates than as a trend, and it occurred shortly after a major oceanographic regime shift in the North Pacific Ocean. The shift in whale sighting dates occurred equally in the onset of the migrations (when the first 10\% of the whales passed a site), the median (50\%) and end (when 90\% of the whales passed). At Granite Canyon, there were no significant trends in these dates prior to 1980 or in dates following the shift. In mid-February (median = 15 February, CI = 1.9, at Point Vicente), few gray whales are still going south and some are already migrating north. Most of the migration (the period between the 10\% and 90\% sighting dates) occurs across a period of 34 days (CI = 2.0), but the entire southbound migration may take {\textgreater} 70 days to pass a location in any given year. It takes a whale approximately 54 days to migrate from the north central Bering Sea to the lagoons in Baja California (8,000km), but some whales may travel as far as 10,000km. Based on available observations and calculations using a travel rate of 147km/day, current median (peak) sighting dates of the southbound migration should be: 1 December in the north central Bering Sea (here considered the theoretical starting point for the migration); 12 December at Unimak Pass, Alaska; 18 December for Kodiak Island, Alaska; 5 January for Washington State; 7 January for Oregon; 15 January for central California; 18 January in southern California; and 24 January at the northern lagoons in Baja California (considered here to be the terminus of the migration). Although no observations were made at Granite Canyon in 1998/99, sightings made at Yaquina Head, Oregon (median sighting date = 7 January) and at Point Vicente (median = 20 January) indicate that the timing of that migration was consistent with previous years.},
