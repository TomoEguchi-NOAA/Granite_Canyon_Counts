	abstract = {With accelerating climate variability and change, novel approaches are needed to warn managers of changing ecosystem state and to identify appropriate management actions. One strategy is using indicator species—like seabirds as ecosystem sentinels—to monitor changes in marine environments. Here, we explore the utility of western gulls (
              Larus occidentalis
              ) breeding on Southeast Farallon Island as a proxy of ecosystem state in coastal California by investigating the interannual variability in gull foraging behavior from 2013 to 2019 in relation to upwelling conditions, prey abundances, and overlap with humpback whales (
              Megaptera novaeangliae
              ) as gulls frequently feed in association with whales. Western gulls have a flexible diet and forage on land and at-sea. We combined gull GPS tracking data during the incubation phase, ecosystem survey data on multiple predator and prey species, and derived oceanographic upwelling products. When foraging at sea, gulls overlapped with cool upwelled waters. During 2015–2017, 25\% more gull foraging trips visited land than in other years, where land trips were on average ∼8 h longer and 40\% further than sea trips, which coincided with high compression of coastally upwelled waters (habitat compression) in 2015–2016. Gull foraging behavior was related to local prey abundances, where more foraging occurred near shore or on land when prey abundances were low. However, visual surveys indicated that ∼70\% of humpback whale observations co-occurred with gulls, and the year with the most foraging on land (2017) corresponded to regionally low relative whale abundances, suggesting gull movement patterns could be an indicator of whale presence. Further, both whales and gulls forage near-shore under high upwelling habitat compression and low krill abundance. Hence, the deployment of year-round tags on gulls with the capability of near real-time data accessibility could provide important fine-scale metrics for conservation and management of the threatened yet recovering eastern Pacific humpback whale population between infrequent and coarse surveys. Entanglement in fishing gear and ship strikes are major inhibitors to whale recovery and have increased concomitantly with human use of ocean resources. Moreover, as climate variability and change increase, novel indicators should be explored and implemented to inform marine spatial planning and protect species across multiple scales from new risks.},

	abstract = {The North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis (NARW), currently numbering {\textless} 410 individuals, is on a trajectory to extinction. Although direct mortality from ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements remain the major threats to the population, reproductive failure, resulting from poor body condition and sublethal chronic entanglement stress, is believed to play a crucial role in the population decline. Using photogrammetry from unmanned aerial vehicles, we conducted the largest population assessment of right whale body condition to date, to determine if the condition of NARWs was poorer than 3 seemingly healthy (i.e. growing) populations of southern right whales E. australis (SRWs) in Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. We found that NARW juveniles, adults and lactating females all had lower body condition scores compared to the SRW populations. While some of the difference could be the result of genetic isolation and adaptations to local environmental conditions, the magnitude suggests that NARWs are in poor condition, which could be suppressing their growth, survival, age of sexual maturation and calving rates. NARW calves were found to be in good condition. Their body length, however, was strongly determined by the body condition of their mothers, suggesting that the poor condition of lactating NARW females may cause a reduction in calf growth rates. This could potentially lead to a reduction in calf survival or an increase in female calving intervals. Hence, the poor body condition of individuals within the NARW population is of major concern for its future viability.},

Causes of embryonic mortality, a contributing factor to the low hatch success of the species, are poorly understood. Muscle necrosis, renal mineralization, and bacterial pneumonia are prevalent among embryos and hatchlings in St. Kitts, where hatch success is much lower (,{\textasciitilde} 20\%) than the global average ({\textasciitilde} 50\%), yet the signiﬁcance of these conditions in the wider region is unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the pathology of hatchlings and embryos in Grenada as a comparison population for St. Kitts. In 2017, 20 hatchlings, 6 pipped hatchlings, 35 late stage embryos, and 5 early stage embryos were sampled for comprehensive postmortem examination from 12 leatherback nests on Levera Beach, Grenada and 2 nests on St. Kitts. Pathology affected 71\% of nests and 44\% of individuals from Grenada and 100\% of nests and 56\% of individuals from St. Kitts. Lesions observed in both populations included skeletal muscle degeneration and necrosis (19\%), bronchopneumonia (8\%), and renal tubular degeneration (5\%) while chorioallantoitis (17\%) and mycotic dermatitis (5\%) were only observed in Grenada. Gonads were histologically classiﬁed as female in all instances (n = 60), suggestive of high incubation temperatures in nests at both locations. Further study is needed to ﬁnd interventions that reduce the prevalence of perinatal pathology and to identify the basis for the large proportion of eggs that fail to develop as well as embryos that die without signiﬁcant pathology.},

Two of the forms are pelagic: the eastern and whitebelly, and two are coastal: the Central American and Tres Marias spinner dolphins. Of these, only the Tres Marias form lacks recognition appropriate for developing management and conservation plans. Vertical aerial photographs of 57 spinner dolphin schools taken between 1988 and 2006 were used to examine the range of coastal forms and to characterize their calving seasons. On the basis of adult body length, spinner dolphins photographed off Guerrero, Mexico, were identiﬁed as those of the Central American form, which is north of their known range, and those photographed farther north, approximately 112 km off Nayarit, Mexico, were identiﬁed as the Tres Marias form. Calving peaked from October through March, and there was evidence that calving seasons differed among geographic forms with coastal forms calving later than pelagic forms. We present the ﬁrst life history parameter estimates for the coastal forms of spinner dolphins, provide additional support for recognition of the Tres Marias form, and the ﬁrst evidence of the Central American form occurring north of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico.},

	abstract = {Recovery of cetacean carcasses provides data on levels of human-caused mortality, but represents only a minimum count of impacts. Counts of stranded carcasses are negatively biased by factors that include at-sea scavenging, sinking, drift away from land, stranding in locations where detection is unlikely, and natural removal from beaches due to wave and tidal action prior to detection. We estimate the fraction of carcasses recovered for a population of coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), using abundance and survival rate data to estimate annual deaths in the population. Observed stranding numbers are compared to expected deaths to estimate the fraction of carcasses recovered. For the California coastal population of bottlenose dolphins, we estimate the fraction of carcasses recovered to be 0.25 (95\% CI = 0.20–0.33). During a 12 yr period, 327 animals (95\% CI = 253–413) were expected to have died and been available for recovery, but only 83 carcasses attributed to this population were documented. Given the coastal habits of California coastal bottlenose dolphins, it is likely that carcass recovery rates of this population greatly exceed recovery rates of more pelagic dolphin species in the region.},

Post-event health status is often unknown because whales are seen once or over short spans that conceal longterm health declines. Well-studied populations with high site ﬁdelity veriﬁed by photo-ID offer opportunity to conﬁrm deaths, health declines and recoveries. We used known outcome entanglements and vessel strikes of right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) to model probabilities of deaths, health declines and recoveries with Random Forest (RF) classiﬁcation trees. Variables included presence or absence of phrases from case narratives (‘deep laceration’, ‘cyamid’, ‘healing’, ‘superﬁcial’) and a categorical variable for vessel size. Health status post-entanglement was correctly classiﬁed in 95.7\% of right whale and 93.6\% of humpback whale cases (expected by chance=50\%). Health status post-vessel strike was correctly classiﬁed in 91.4\% of right whale and 88.6\% of humpback whale cases. Important variables included cyamid presence, emaciation, discolored skin, constricting entanglements, gear-free resightings, superﬁcial or healing lacerations, and vessel size. Cross-validated RF models were applied to unknown outcome cases to estimate the probability of deaths, health declines and recoveries. Total serious injuries (probability of death or health decline {\textgreater} 0.50) assigned by RF were nearly equal to current injury assessment methods applied by biologists for known outcomes. However, RF consistently predicted higher serious injury totals for unknown outcomes, suggesting that current assessment methods may underestimate risk for cases lacking details or long-term observations. Advantages of the RF method include: 1) risk models are based on known outcomes; 2) unknown outcomes are assigned post-event health status probabilities; and 3) identiﬁcation of important predictor variables improves data collection standards.},

Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), ﬁn whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were the most frequently sighted baleen whales with overall densities of 0.91/1000 km2 (CV ¼ 0.27), 2.73/ 1000 km2 (CV ¼ 0.19), and 1.17/1000 km2 (CV ¼ 0.21) respectively. Species speciﬁc density estimates, stratiﬁed by cruise, were analyzed using a generalized additive model to estimate long-term trends and correct for seasonal imbalances. Variances were estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap with one day of effort as the sampling unit. Blue whales were primarily observed during summer and fall while ﬁn and humpback whales were observed year-round with peaks in density during summer and spring respectively. Short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), Paciﬁc white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) and Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoidesdalli) were the most frequently encountered small cetaceans with overall densities of 705.83/1000 km2 (CV ¼ 0.22), 51.98/1000 km2 (CV ¼0.27), and 21.37/1000 km2 (CV ¼ 0.19) respectively. Seasonally, short-beaked common dolphins were most abundant in winter whereas Paciﬁc white-sided dolphins and Dall’s porpoise were most abundant during spring. There were no signiﬁcant long-term changes in blue whale, ﬁn whale, humpback whale, shortbeaked common dolphin or Dall’s porpoise densities while Paciﬁc white-sided dolphins exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in density across the ten-year study.

            Monitoring waterbird populations in Australia is challenging for reasons of counting logistics, and because population aggregation and dispersion can shift rapidly in response to large spatio-temporal variations in resource availability. The East Australian Waterbird survey has conducted annual, aerial, systematic counts of waterbirds over eastern Australia for almost 40 years. It was designed to monitor waterbird populations using design-based inference though for many species this form of inference appears inadequate in the face of these challenges. Here we develop a state-space model-based Bayesian approach that, in addition to explicitly incorporating process noise and observation uncertainty, uses random effects and rainfall-derived covariates to model the year-to-year variation in the proportion of the total (super) population that is present on surveyed wetlands, and available to be counted. We use this model-based approach to estimate the superpopulation size of 45 waterbird species annually, and model the rate of population increase as a function of antecedent rainfall. The results confirm the strong positive effect of antecedent rainfall on population growth rates for nearly all species, and illustrate that species respond to rainfall differently in terms of habitat use, which influences whether they are present on surveyed wetlands. For many species, the year-to-year variation in the estimated proportion of the population on surveyed wetlands is very high. The results have implications for making inferences on population trends from these data, with the ability to model the year-to-year sampling variation a key requirement before the rate of population increase can be estimated with any precision. This study illustrates how to progress this approach, and infers that under average rainfall conditions, the general trend is for estimated superpopulation rates of increase to be negative, though for only a few species is this occurring with strong belief.},

Tidal currents were measured with a bottom-mounted Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP) and the data used to predict tidal current speed and direction at the location and time during which turtles were tracked. Twenty-nine turtles were tracked in the summers of 2000 to 2003. Vagility (mean ± SD; 18.6 ± 11.4 km d–1) and speed (0.83 ± 0.47 km h–1) of turtles was the greatest so far reported for green turtles at foraging areas. Turtles displayed highly linear movements, and movement patterns were circatidal. Vector correlation was used to compare turtle speed and direction with tidal speed and direction. Correlation coefficients were significant for 11 out of 13 tracks, indicating significant linear interdependence between turtles and tides. Speed and direction contributed equally to the correlation. Results indicated a new paradigm for green turtles in feeding areas, where turtles are transported on continual tides that allow them to exploit a patchy and seasonal distribution of algae, their main diet component. This tidal transport is markedly different than Selective Tidal Stream Transport, in which animals use either the ebb or flood tide for transport. Tidal currents may be an accurate indicator of turtle movement in tidal areas, and this transport system has implications for foraging ecology, energetics, and growth.},

	abstract = {Background: The juvenile stage of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) can last for decades. In the North Pacific Ocean, much is known about their seasonal movements in relation to pelagic habitat, yet understanding their multi-year, basin-scale movements has proven more difficult. Here, we categorize the large-scale movements of 231 turtles satellite tracked from 1997 to 2013 and explore the influence of biological and environmental drivers on basin-scale movement.
Results: Results show high residency of juvenile loggerheads within the Central North Pacific and a moderate influence of the Earth’s magnetic field, but no real-time environmental driver to explain migratory behavior.
Conclusions: We suggest the Central North Pacific acts as important developmental foraging grounds for young juvenile loggerhead sea turtles, rather than just a migratory corridor. We propose several hypotheses that may influence the connectivity between western and eastern juvenile loggerhead foraging grounds in the North Pacific Ocean.},

	abstract = {Highly migratory marine species can travel long distances and across entire ocean basins to reach foraging and breeding grounds, yet gaps persist in our knowledge of oceanic dispersal and habitat use. This is especially true for sea turtles, whose complex life history and lengthy pelagic stage present unique conservation challenges. Few studies have explored how these young at-sea turtles navigate their environment, but advancements in satellite technology and numerical models have shown that active and passive movements are used in relation to open ocean features. Here, we provide the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to simultaneously combine a high-resolution physical forcing ocean circulation model with long-term multi-year tracking data of young, trans-oceanic North Pacific loggerhead sea turtles during their ‘lost years’ at sea. From 2010 to 2014, we compare simulated trajectories of passive transport with empirical data of 1–3 year old turtles released off Japan (29.7–37.5 straight carapace length cm). After several years, the at-sea distribution of simulated current-driven trajectories significantly differed from that of the observed turtle tracks. These results underscore current theories on active dispersal by young oceanic-stage sea turtles and give further weight to hypotheses of juvenile foraging strategies for this species. Such information can also provide critical geographical information for spatially explicit conservation approaches to this endangered population.},

The evaluation of temperature proﬁles collected by STs against collocated ARGO drifter measurements show good agreement at all sample depths (0–250 m). Comparisons against various operational satellite sea surface temperature (SST) products indicate a slight overestimation of ST-borne temperature observations of ∼0.1◦±◦0.6◦ that is nevertheless consistent with expected uncertainties on satellite-derived SST data. Comparisons of ST-borne surface and subsurface temperature observations against Glo12 temperature forecasts demonstrate the good performance of the model surface and subsurface ({\textless}50 m) temperature predictions in the West tropical Indian Ocean, with mean bias (resp. RMS) in the range of 0.2◦ (resp. 0.5–1.5◦). At deeper depths ({\textgreater}50 m), the model is, however, shown to signiﬁcantly underestimate ocean temperatures as already noticed from global evaluation scores performed operationally at the basin scale. The distribution of model errors also shows signiﬁcant spatial and temporal variability in the ﬁrst 50 m of the ocean, which will be further investigated in the next phases of the STORM project.},

However, for many marine mammal populations, this knowledge is currently lacking and it may take decades to ﬁll the gaps. During this time, undetected population declines may occur. In this study we identify methods that can be used to monitor populations subject to disturbance and provide insights into the processes through which disturbance may affect them. To identify and address the knowledge gaps highlighted above, we reviewed the literature to identify suitable response variables and methods for monitoring these variables. We also used existing models of the population consequences of disturbance (PCoD) to identify demographic characteristics (e.g., the proportion of immature animals in the population, or the ratio of calves/pups to mature females) that may be strongly correlated with population status and therefore provide early warnings of future changes in abundance. These demographic characteristics can be monitored using established methods such as visual surveys combined with photogrammetry, and capture-recapture analysis. Individual health and physiological variables can also inform PCoD assessment and can be monitored using photogrammetry, remote tissue sampling, hands-on assessment and individual tracking. We then conducted a workshop to establish the relative utility and feasibility of all these approaches for different groups of marine mammal species. We describe how future marine mammal monitoring programs can be designed to inform population-level analysis.},

	abstract = {Sea turtle embryos at high-density nesting beaches experience relative high rates of early stage embryo death. One hypothesis to explain this high mortality rate is that there is an increased probability that newly constructed nests are located close to maturing clutches whose metabolising embryos cause low oxygen levels, high carbon dioxide levels, and high temperatures. Although these altered environmental conditions are well tolerated by mature embryos, early stage embryos, i.e. embryos in eggs that have only been incubating for less than a week, may not be as tolerant leading to an increase in their mortality. To test this hypothesis, we incubated newly laid sea turtle eggs over a range of temperatures in different combinations of oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and assessed embryo development and death rates. We found that gas mixtures of decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide, similar to those found in natural sea turtle nests containing mature embryos, slowed embryonic development but did not influence the mortality rate of early stage embryos. We found incubation temperature had no effect on early embryo mortality but growth rate at 27˚C and 34˚C was slower than at 30˚C and 33˚C. Our findings indicate that low oxygen and high carbon dioxide partial pressures are not the cause of the high early stage embryo mortality observed at high-density sea turtle nesting beaches, but there is evidence suggesting high incubation temperatures, particularly above 34˚C are harmful. Any management strategies that can increase the spacing between nests or other strategies such as shading or irrigation that reduce sand temperature are likely to increase hatching success at high-density nesting beaches.},

Globally distributed, wide-ranging whales and dolphins present a particular challenge in data collection because no single research team can record data over biologically meaningful areas. Flukebook.org is an open-source web platform that addresses these gaps by providing researchers with the latest computational tools. It integrates photo-identification algorithms with data management, sharing, and privacy infrastructure for whale and dolphin research, enabling the global collaborative study of these global species. With seven automatic identification algorithms trained for 15 different species, resulting in 37 species-specific identification pipelines, Flukebook is an extensible foundation that continually incorporates emerging AI techniques and applies them to cetacean photo identification through continued collaboration between computer vision researchers, software engineers, and biologists. With over 2.0 million photos of over 52,000 identified individual animals submitted by over 250 researchers, the platform enables a comprehensive understanding of cetacean populations, fostering international and cross-institutional collaboration while respecting data ownership and privacy. We outline the technology stack and architecture of Flukebook, its performance on real-world cetacean imagery, and its development as an example of scalable, extensible, and reusable open-source conservation software. Flukebook is a step change in our ability to conduct large-scale research on cetaceans across biologically meaningful geographic ranges, to rapidly iterate population assessments and abundance trajectories, and engage the public in actions to protect them.},

In this study, we examined the trend in leatherback abundance off central California from 28 years of aerial survey data from coast-wide and adaptive ﬁne-scale surveys. We used a Bayesian hierarchical analysis framework, including a process model of leatherback population density and an observation model relating leatherback observations to distance sampling methods. We also used time-depth data from biologgers deployed on 21 foraging leatherback turtles in the study area to account for detection biases associated with diving animals. Our results indicate that leatherback abundance has declined at an annual rate of À5.6\% (95\% credible interval À9.8\% to À1.5\%), without any marked changes in ocean conditions or prey availability. These results are similar to the nesting population trends of À5.9\% and À6.1\% per year estimated at Indonesian index beaches, which comprise 75\% of western Paciﬁc nesting activity. Combined, the declining trends underscore the need for coordinated international conservation efforts and long-term population monitoring to avoid extirpation of western Paciﬁc leatherback turtles.},

	abstract = {The western Pacific leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), one of three genetically distinct stocks in the Indo-Pacific region, has declined markedly during past decades. This metapopulation nests year-round at beaches of several western Pacific island nations and has been documented through genetic analysis and telemetry studies to occur in multiple regions of the Pacific Ocean. To provide a large-scale perspective of their movements, high-use areas, and habitat associations, we report and synthesize results of 126 satellite telemetry deployments conducted on leatherbacks at western Pacific nesting beaches and at one eastern Pacific foraging ground during 2000–2007. A Bayesian switching state-space model was applied to raw Argos-acquired surface locations to estimate daily positions and behavioral mode (either transiting or area-restricted search) for each turtle. Monthly areas of high use were identified for postnesting periods using kernel density estimation. There was a clear separation of migratory destinations for boreal summer vs. boreal winter nesters. Leatherbacks that nested during boreal summer moved into Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of the temperate North Pacific Ocean or into tropical waters of the South China Sea. Turtles that nested during boreal winter moved into temperate and tropical LMEs of the southern hemisphere. Area-restricted search occurred in temperate and tropical waters at diverse pelagic and coastal regions exhibiting a wide range of oceanographic features, including mesoscale eddies, coastal retention areas, current boundaries, or stationary fronts, all of which are known mechanisms for aggregating leatherback prey. Use of the most distant and temperate foraging ground, the California Current LME, required a 10–12 month trans-Pacific migration and commonly involved multiple years of migrating between high-latitude summer foraging grounds and low-latitude eastern tropical Pacific wintering areas without returning to western Pacific nesting beaches. In contrast, tropical foraging destinations were reached within 5–7 months and appeared to support year-round foraging, potentially allowing a more rapid return to nesting beaches. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that demographic differences are likely among nesting females using different LMEs of the Indo-Pacific. The differences in movements and foraging strategies underscore the importance of and the need for ecosystem-based management and coordinated Pacific-wide conservation efforts.},

For over three decades, the federal government has formally recognized the impact of fishery disasters via federal declarations. Despite these impacts, national syntheses of the dynamics, impacts, and causes of fishery disasters are lacking. We developed a nationwide Federal Fishery Disaster database using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fishery disaster declarations and fishery revenue data. From 1989-2020, there were 71 federally approved fishery disasters (eleven are pending), which spanned every federal fisheries management region and coastal state in the country. To date, we estimate fishery disasters resulted in \$2B (2019 USD) in Congressional allocations, and an additional, conservative estimate of \$3.2B (2019 USD) in direct revenue loss. Despite this scale of impact, the disaster assistance process is largely ad hoc and lacks sufficient detail to properly assess allocation fairness and benefit. Nonetheless, fishery disasters increased in frequency over time, and the causes of disasters included a broad range of anthropogenic and environmental factors, with a recent shift to disasters now almost exclusively caused by extreme environmental events (e.g., marine heatwaves, hurricanes, and harmful algal blooms). Nationwide, 84.5\% of fishery disasters were either partially or entirely attributed to extreme environmental events. As climate change drives higher rates of such extreme events, and as natural disaster assistance requests reach an all-time high, the federal system for fisheries disaster declaration and mitigation must evolve in order to effectively protect both fisheries sustainability and societal benefit.},

Models were developed for a time series from the 1990–91 to 2016–17 nesting season that included 21 years of sampling, with predicted trends evaluated against samples from the 2017–18 nesting season. The number of clutches laid and nester abundance rate of decline varied over the study period, but the decline was markedly similar with a 58 and 57\% overall reduction, respectively. Annual survival rate was high (0.972, 95\% CI = 0.965 to 0.977), but was not estimated separately for all years.

The large human lockdown and its eventual relaxation can be viewed as a Global Human Conﬁnement Experiment. This experiment is a unique opportunity to identify positive and negative eﬀects of human presence and mobility on a range of natural systems, including wildlife, and protected areas, and to study processes regulating biodiversity and ecosystems. We encourage ecologists, environmental scientists, and resource managers to contribute their observations to eﬀorts aiming to build comprehensive global understanding based on multiple data streams, including anecdotal observations, systematic assessments and quantitative monitoring. We argue that the collective power of combining diverse data will transcend the limited value of the individual data sets and produce unexpected insights. We can also consider the conﬁnement experiment as a “stress test” to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in the adequacy of existing networks to detect human impacts on natural systems. Doing so will provide evidence for the value of the conservation strategies that are presently in place, and create future networks, observatories and policies that are more adept in protecting biological diversity across the world.},

Assessing persistent organic pollutants (POP) in green turtle aggregations in the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge (SBNWR, n = 17) and San Diego Bay (SDB, n = 25) can help quantify contamination risks for these populations. Blood plasma was analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). PCBs and body size explained much of the separation of turtles by foraging aggregation in a principal component analysis. Turtles from SDB had signiﬁcantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher total PCBs than SBNWR turtles. Most PCBs detected in turtles were non-dioxin-like PCB congeners (153, 138, 99) that are associated with neurotoxicity. Recaptured turtles' POP levels changed signiﬁcantly over time indicating signiﬁcant variation in POP levels through time and space, even among adjacent foraging locations.},

To gauge how neonatal movements set the stage for later habitat use, we tracked neonate leatherback turtles (n = 94) with acoustic tags from Pacuare, Costa Rica, in 2016 and 2018. We analyzed movements using a ﬁrst passage time analysis and random walk models, the results of which indicated neonates followed a ﬁxed compass direction as they traveled away from shore and that strong currents in these areas resulted in advection. We combined the tracking data with concurrent environmental variables in a generalized additive mixed model framework. Our results showed the south-east current ﬂow in this area has spatial and temporal structure consistent with large-scale geostrophic currents and not tidal current or local wind speed inﬂuences. After accounting for advection by currents, true neonate swimming speed was signiﬁcantly related to current speed, ﬁrst passage time, and the year. Neonates had three main response strategies to currents above 0.5 m s−1, with most increasing their swimming speed and the rest maintaining either a constant or decreased swimming speed. Neonates were signiﬁcantly larger in 2018 than in 2016 but their average swimming speed was not signiﬁcantly related to body size, indicating that environmental factors were more important contributors to their dispersal. We conclude that abiotic factors, including the strength and direction of the currents, signiﬁcantly affect the swimming and dispersal strategy of neonate leatherback turtles and these results can help to inform strategies for releases of neonate turtles from hatcheries, future tracking studies, and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Multispecies aggregations of tuna, dolphins, and seabirds are prevalent and conspicuous in the vast waters of the eastern tropical Pacific and form the basis of a commercial fishery for yellowfin tuna (
              Thunnus albacares
              ) through setting on schools of dolphins, which is among the largest tuna fisheries in the world. Incidental dolphin mortality associated with the development and early years of the fishery was high; by 1993 it was estimated that eastern spinner dolphins (
              Stenella longirostris orientalis
              ) had been reduced to 44\% and northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (
              S. attenuata attenuata
              ) to 19\% of pre-fishery levels. Efforts to reduce this mortality began at the inception of the fishery and comprised a diverse array of approaches: modifications to fishing methods and fishing gear (backdown, Medina panel, high-intensity floodlights, swimmers to disentangle and release dolphins); U.S. legislation (through the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, MMPA, and subsequent amendments); international agreements (including the International Dolphin Conservation Program that established dolphin mortality limits, and the legally binding multilateral Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program); and economic incentives [notably through establishment of the U.S. dolphin-safe label and positive certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)]. Together, these bycatch mitigation efforts have been remarkably successful; dolphin mortality due to entanglement as recorded by fisheries observers (hereafter, entanglement mortality) has been reduced by \&gt; 99\%. Despite this, the degree to which dolphin populations have recovered remains unclear. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that individual dolphins experience multiple sets in their lifetimes and although causality has not been established, research suggests that chase and encirclement might have impacts on dolphins in addition to entanglement mortality. These impacts potentially include increased fetal and/or calf mortality, separation of nursing females and their calves, decreased fecundity, increased predation, disruption of mating and other social systems, and ecological disruption. The strong management emphasis on monitoring entanglement mortality, and the infrastructure necessary to support this monitoring (in particular, 100\% observer coverage on large purse-seiners) require funding to the extent that other activities, particularly continued surveys to monitor stock status and clarify the potential influence of other effects of the fishery on dolphin populations, are currently inadequately funded.},

However, obtaining this information for endangered leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) is particularly challenging due to unusual physiology and prevalence of remote oceanic habitat use, which limit direct observation. While inference has been made through indirect approaches such as captive, genetic, and/or skeletal growth mark (skeletochronology) studies, these diverse methods have yielded similarly varied results, limiting usefulness of available information for management and conservation. To address this data gap, we conducted refined skeletochronological analysis of Atlantic and Pacific leatherback scleral ossicle bones, allowing estimation of carapace length-at-age relationships throughout individual turtles’ lives, including the juvenile life stage. In addition, this improved approach made it possible to estimate mean and range for age and size at sexual maturation (ASM and SSM, respectively), as well as post-maturation longevity. Updated mean ASM estimates from the current study of 17–19 years were lower than those previously proposed using skeletochronology and more similar to predictions from captive growth and genetic data. Maximum estimates of reproductive longevity (18–22 years) were consistent with the 16–19 years reported previously from mark–recapture of nesting females. Together, these results indicate that the application of the refined analytical approach described in the current study may offer opportunities to increase understanding of leatherback age and growth.},

Yellowﬁn tuna aged 2–18 years (n = 34, 1029–1810 mm FL) and bigeye tuna aged 3–17 years (n = 12, 1280–1750 mm FL) led to birth years that were coincident with the bomb radiocarbon decline.

Despite their broad range, importance as a top predator and attraction among anglers, the age and longevity of giant trevally remain largely undescribed and there are concerns that giant trevally are being fished down in the Hawaiian Islands. The most comprehensive age and growth study was performed in the Hawaiian Islands, but the work was limited to early growth observations. Although a study of daily increments was limited to fish less than maximum size, a model used to describe the growth characteristics was extrapolated to estimate that maximum age may exceed 20 years. In this study, otoliths of giant trevally from the Hawaiian Islands were investigated for annual growth zones, and the validity of the age estimates was tested and validated with bomb 14C dating. Revised growth parameters indicate giant trevally grow rapidly in the Hawaiian Islands and can attain an age of 25 years.},

Due partly to their imperiled status, the US National Marine Fisheries Service established a time-area closure in 2003 for the California drift gillnet (CDGN) fishery operating within the Southern California Bight (SCB) to avoid incidental captures. This closure is triggered when sea surface temperatures are above normal, generally caused by El Niño-derived warm-water conditions, which is the time when loggerheads are thought to enter the SCB. Knowledge of the previous foraging grounds of loggerheads incidentally captured by the CDGN fishery in the SCB will help elucidate the oceanographic mechanisms that may influence turtle movement into this region and can assist in optimizing the environmental triggers for implementation of the SCB fishing closure. Stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope analysis was used to determine the previous foraging grounds of loggerheads encountered in the SCB. Skin samples from loggerheads captured in the CDGN fishery were compared with skin from loggerheads in the central North Pacific, incidentally caught in the Hawaii-based longline fishery, as well as skin from turtles sampled during in-water research along the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. The stable isotope values of CDGN-caught turtles were more similar to those from the central North Pacific than to those from Baja, indicating movements from the central North Pacific to the SCB. We elaborate on potential oceanographic mechanisms by which turtles access the SCB and provide insights that can inform future management decisions for the time-area closure.},

Field measurements of water column optical properties also were compared to similar data sets from other rivers to provide context for our results. We considered field spectra, a multispectral satellite image, hyperspectral data collected from conventional and unmanned aircraft, and a bathymetric LiDAR and applied a generalized version of Optimal Band Ratio Analysis and the K nearest neighbors regression machine learning algorithm. Linear, quadratic, exponential, power, and lowess Optimal Band Ratio Analysis models enabled flexible curve-fitting in calibrating spectrally based quantities to depth; an exponential formulation avoided artifacts associated with other model types. K nearest neighbors regression increased observed versus predicted (OP) R2 values, particularly for the satellite image; we also found that preprocessing of satellite images was unnecessary and that a basic data product could be used for depth retrieval. Bathymetric LiDAR was highly accurate and precise in shallow water, but a lack of bottom returns from areas greater than 2 m deep resulted in large gaps in coverage. The maximum detectable depth imposes an important constraint on fluvial remote sensing and a hybrid approach combined with field surveys of deep areas might be a more realistic operational strategy for bathymetric mapping.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Failure to improve the conservation status of endangered species is often related to inadequate allocation of conservation resources to highest priority issues. Eastern Pacific (EP) leatherbacks are perhaps the most endangered sea turtle population in the world, and continue on a path to regional extinction. To provide coherent, regional conservation targets, we developed a population viability analysis and examined hypothetical scenarios describing effects of conservation activities that either reduced mortality or increased production of hatchlings (or both). Under status quo conditions, EP leatherbacks will be extirpated in {\textless}60 yr. To ensure a positive, long-term population trajectory, conservation efforts must increase adult survivorship (i.e., reduce adult mortality) by ≥20\%, largely through reduction of fisheries bycatch mortality. Positive trajectories can be accelerated by increased production of hatchlings through enhanced nest protection and treatment. We estimate that these efforts must save approximately 200–260 adult and subadult leatherbacks and produce approximately 7,000–8,000 more hatchlings annually. Critically, reductions in late-stage mortality must begin within 5 years and reach 20\% overall within the next 10–15 years to ensure population stabilization and eventual increase. These outcomes require expanded, sustained, coordinated, high-priority efforts among several entities working at multiple scales. Fortunately, such efforts are underway.},

	abstract = {Understanding how climate change impacts species and ecosystems is integral to conservation. When studying impacts of climate change, warming temperatures are a research focus, with much less attention given to extreme weather events and their impacts. Here, we show how localized, extreme rainfall events can have a major impact on a species that is endangered in many parts of its range. We report incubation temperatures from the world's largest green sea turtle rookery, during a breeding season when two extreme rainfall events occurred. Rainfall caused nest temperatures to drop suddenly and the maximum drop in temperature for each rain-induced cooling averaged 3.6°C (n = 79 nests, min = 1.0°C, max = 7.4°C). Since green sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination, with low incubation temperatures producing males, such major rainfall events may have a masculinization effect on primary sex ratios. Therefore, in some cases, extreme rainfall events may provide a “get-out-of-jail-free card” to avoid complete feminization of turtle populations as climate warming continues.},

	abstract = {Between 1967 and 2007, 23 seasons of shore-based counts of the Eastern North Pacific (ENP) stock of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) were conducted throughout all or most of the southbound migration near Carmel, California. Population estimates have been derived from these surveys using a variety of techniques that were adapted as the data collection protocol evolved. The subsequent time series of estimates was used to evaluate trend and population status, resulting in the conclusion that the population was no longer endangered and had achieved its optimum sustainable population (OSP) level. We re-evaluated the data from all of the surveys using a common estimation procedure and an improved method for treatment of error in pod size and detection probability estimation. The newly derived abundance estimates between 1967 and 1987 were generally larger (–2.5\% to 21\%) than previous abundance estimates. However, the opposite was the case for survey years 1992 to 2006, with estimates declining from –4.9\% to –29\%. This pattern is largely explained by the differences in the correction for pod size bias, which occurred because the pod sizes in the calibration data over-represented pods of two or more whales and underrepresented single whales relative to the estimated true pod size distribution.},

	abstract = {Indicators for preserving marine biodiversity include knowledge of how the spatial distribution and critical habitats of species overlap with human activities and impacts. Such indicators are key tools for marine spatial planning, a process that identiﬁes and resolves conﬂicts between human uses and the conservation of marine environments. The common bottlenose dolphin in the Mediterranean Sea is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List and a priority species of the EU Habitat Directive. Here, we estimated spatio-temporal patterns of the species occurrence in the area around one Marine Protected Area (MPA) and two Sites of Community Importance (SCI) of the North western Sardinia, with the aim to predict the species distribution and the main links with the environmental factors and boat trafﬁc. To evaluate whether dolphin groups with calves showed any habitat preference different from groups without calves, separate models for both type of groups were done. The most important contributing variables to the dolphin habitat suitability models were the likelihood of boat presence, habitat type and mean sea surface temperature. Different model outputs were obtained depending on dolphin group composition. The area of high likelihood of dolphin presence ranged between 30 and 60 km2 and was smaller for groups with calves. Further, the area of highest dolphin habitat suitability overlaps with the area of high boat trafﬁc, suggesting that boating in the study site is a potential relevant anthropogenic threat to dolphins. Particularly, boating is concentrated inside and around the MPA/SCIs, indicating the need for stronger restriction measures. We propose updated SCI boundaries for effective protection of common bottlenose dolphins. These areas and the suggestions of regulation are speciﬁcally aimed at reducing the impact of boating on dolphins, especially for groups with calves. Synthesis and applications. Management measures should be designed based on the data here provided, and then implemented and enforced to decrease dolphin-boat interactions, especially for mother-calf pairs. The creation of new coastal SCIs should be considered especially where boat trafﬁc overlaps with areas most suitable for dolphins. In these SCIs, boating should be managed to limit disturbance, avoidance or alterations of dolphin vital behavior.},

	abstract = {Background: Women and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The goal of this pilot study is to better understand the beliefs and experiences of underrepresented US students pursuing STEM. Our focus was to gain insights into their mentorship experiences and preferences regarding having mentors who are gender and ethnicity matched. Environmental and psychological factors associated with participants’ decision to pursue STEM, such as family influences, academic mindsets, and attitudes towards STEM, were also studied.
Methods: We developed a survey tool based on published literature and established instruments, including measures of STEM belonging, science identity, and growth mindset, as well as measures assessing students’ views on their STEM participation. We surveyed members of a STEM-focused non-profit who were in college, graduate school, or were recent graduates.
Results: Forty-eight adults currently pursuing STEM responded to the survey. The majority (71\%) were female and nearly all (96\%) identified as an ethnic minority. Most reported knowing someone of their same gender (68\%) or ethnicity (66\%) with a STEM career who served as a role model. The majority (54\%) stated that meeting a STEM professional of their own gender and ethnicity would be effective encouragement to pursue STEM. A similar percentage (56\%) believed that media exposure to gender- and ethnicity-matched STEM professionals would be effective encouragement. Most (73\%) demonstrated a growth mindset and had strong family support to pursue STEM (68\%). Only two-thirds (66\%) felt they belonged in STEM careers, and 30\% agreed that people in their STEM classes are a lot like them.
Conclusion: This study contributes additional information on the views and experiences of diverse students actively pursuing STEM. Most participants indicated the importance of meeting and being mentored in STEM by those of their same gender and ethnicity, either in person or through media. Future educational efforts to increase STEM diversity should consider students’ mentorship preferences and facilitate interactions with matched-background mentors accordingly, with consideration given to the use of media. Educators should focus on inclusive learning by highlighting the accomplishments of diverse STEM professionals, to help strengthen feelings of STEM belonging.},

	abstract = {Antarctic fur seals (AFS) are an ecologically important predator and a focal indicator species for ecosystem-based Antarctic ﬁsheries management. This species suffered intensive anthropogenic exploitation until the early 1900s, but recolonized most of its former distribution, including the southern-most colony at Cape Shirreff, South Shetland Islands (SSI). The IUCN describes a single, global AFS population of least concern; however, extensive genetic analyses clearly identify four distinct breeding stocks, including one in the SSI. To update the population status of SSI AFS, we analyzed 20 years of ﬁeld-based data including population counts, body size and condition, natality, recruitment, foraging behaviors, return rates, and pup mortality at the largest SSI colony. Our ﬁndings show a precipitous decline in AFS abundance (86\% decrease since 2007), likely driven by leopard seal predation (increasing since 2001, p {\textless}{\textless} 0.001) and potentially worsening summer foraging conditions. We estimated that leopard seals consumed an average of 69.3\% (range: 50.3–80.9\%) of all AFS pups born each year since 2010. AFS foraging-trip durations, an index of their foraging habitat quality, were consistent with decreasing krill and ﬁsh availability. Signiﬁcant improvement in the age-speciﬁc over-winter body condition of AFS indicates that observed population declines are driven by processes local to the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The loss of SSI AFS would substantially reduce the genetic diversity of the species, and decrease its resilience to climate change. There is an urgent need to reevaluate the conservation status of Antarctic fur seals, particularly for the rapidly declining SSI population.},

	abstract = {Unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) have become common tools for ecological monitoring and management. However, UAS use has the potential to negatively affect wildlife. Both policy makers and practitioners require data about the potential impacts of UAS on natural biota, but few studies exist and some of the published results conﬂict. We conducted two experiments to assess the responses of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus), Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), and leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) to UAS overﬂights. First, to provide a baseline for assessing disturbance from UAS operations, we compare behavioral responses from UAS ﬂights to those from traditional, ground surveys. Second, to inform users and policy makers about preferred ﬂight methods, we assess behavioral and physiological responses to UAS ﬂown at speciﬁc altitudes, during different stages of breeding chronology, and with other site factors. Between January 2017 and March 2018 we conducted 268 UAS ﬂight approaches and 36 ground-based surveys at Cape Shirreff, Antarctic Peninsula. We applied generalized linear mixed effects models and Kruskal-Wallis tests to 10,164 behavioral scores obtained from three independent observers. When directly compared, behavioral responses by all species to UAS overﬂights at 30 m were not different from control periods, while responses to ground surveys were signiﬁcantly more intense. Behavioral responses generally increased as UAS ﬂew lower, and for penguins those increases intensiﬁed as the breeding season progressed (i.e., guard and molt stages). We argue that results from UAS wildlife response studies need to be assessed relative to the impacts of alternative methods, and within the ecological context of the target species. Finally, we suggest data-driven best practices for both UAS use and for the design of future UAS-wildlife response studies.},

	abstract = {Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a family of statistical methods where species occurrence/density/richness are combined with environmental predictors to create predictive spatial models of species distribution. However, it often turns out that due to complex multi-level interactions between predictors and the response function, different types of models can detect different numbers of important predictors and also vary in their predictive ability. This is why we decided to explore differences in the predictive power of two most common methods, such as the Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and the Random Forest (RF) on the example of the Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major and the Great Grey Shrike Lanius excubitor, as well as on the taxonomic and functional species richness. For each of the two bird species’ densities and for two measurements of biodiversity, two sets of SDMs were generated: One based on the GAM, and the other on the RF. According to the out-of-bag, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and an independent evaluation, we demonstrated that the GAM is the best method for predicting density of the Great Spotted Woodpecker and taxonomic species richness, whereas the RF has the lowest prediction error for the density of the Great Grey Shrike and functional species richness. It also becomes apparent that the GAM is responsive to taxonomic species richness and species with broad tolerance to environmental factors, i.e. the Great Spotted Woodpecker, while the RF detects more subtle relationships between density and environmental variables, rendering it more suitable for functional species richness and species with a narrow tolerance range to habitats factors, i.e. the Great Grey Shrike. Thus, effective predictive modelling of animal distribution requires considering several different analytical approaches to produce biologically realistic predictions.},

Using a nested approach with autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles, a dumpsite oﬀshore California was surveyed and sampled. Discarded waste containers littered the site and structured the suboxic benthic environment. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was reportedly dumped in the area, and sediment analysis revealed substantial variability in concentrations of p,p-DDT and its analogs, with a peak concentration of 257 μg g−1, ∼40 times greater than the highest level of surface sediment contamination at the nearby DDT Superfund site. The occurrence of a conspicuous hydrocarbon mixture suggests that multiple petroleum distillates, potentially used in DDT manufacture, contributed to the waste stream. Application of a two end-member mixing model with DDTs and polychlorinated biphenyls enabled source diﬀerentiation between shelf discharge versus containerized waste. Ocean dumping was found to be the major source of DDT to more than 3000 km2 of the region’s deep seaﬂoor. These results reveal that ocean dumping of containerized DDT waste was inherently sloppy, with the contents readily breaching containment and leading to regional scale contamination of the deep benthos.},

Where and why animals migrate, and what patterns can be derived from individual movements in order to make population-level inferences are key areas when attempting to define basic population dynamics. These questions are of equal interest to biologists and managers, with many species assessments identifying improvements in the understanding of population-level movement as a key research need. We aimed to improve our understanding of population level movement for common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus by leveraging the largest satellite tagging dataset available for this species. Using a Bayesian approach specifically designed to address population-level questions with sparse telemetry data, we identified that A. vulpinus off the west coast of North America are partial migrators which conditionally migrate, based on a combination of fixed intrinsic states (size, sex) and variable extrinsic states (e.g. season, environment). Waters of the Southern California Bight were identified as an area where, seasonally, a large variety of sizes of A. vulpinus can be found. While smaller juveniles can be found throughout the year, larger sub-adults and adults often move out of the Bight during certain seasons (spring and winter). Knowledge of how A. vulpinus distribute along the coast, and that season, size, and to some extent sex, play important roles in where and what type of animals are likely to be found, are key pieces of information when attempting to accurately characterize basic biological parameters like age, growth, and reproduction, as well as understanding the effects of variable fishing pressures across the species’ range.},

	abstract = {With almost limitless applications across marine and freshwater environments, the number of people using, and wanting to use, remotely piloted aircraft systems (or drones) is increasing exponentially. However, successfully using drones for data collection and mapping is often preceded by hours of researching drone capabilities and functionality followed by numerous limited-success flights as users tailor their approach to data collection through trial and error. Working over water can be particularly complex and the published research using drones rarely documents the methodology and practical information in sufficient detail to allow others, with little remote pilot experience, to replicate them or to learn from their mistakes. This can be frustrating and expensive, particularly when working in remote locations where the window of access is small. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical guide to drone-based data acquisition considerations. We hope to minimise the amount of trial and error required to obtain high-quality, map-ready data by outlining the principles and practice of data collection using drones, particularly in marine and freshwater environments. Importantly, our recommendations are grounded in remote sensing and photogrammetry theory so that the data collected are appropriate for making measurements and conducting quantitative data analysis.},

Evidence suggesting the population is producing an extreme proportion of females due to increasing temperatures, coupled with temperature-dependent sex determination, is concerning. In response, and to explore management options, we developed two density-independent, stochastic stagestructured metapopulation models: a “Moderate Climate Model” and an “Extreme Climate Model”. The models differ based on climate change projections by incorporating increased female hatchling sex ratios due to global warming and loss of nesting habitat due to sea level rise. The models were based on demographic data from field studies at major rookeries and regional foraging grounds and allowed for variation in operational sex ratios, management actions, and levels of indigenous harvest. Under the Moderate Climate Model, population size increased but could be vulnerable to overharvest of adult females. If overharvest was indicated, the harvest of a proportion of subadults rather than only adult females reduced population declines. Under the Extreme Climate Model, there was a steep population decline even without any harvest and harvesting subadults accelerated population decline due to the inclusion of subadult males. In the Extreme Climate Model, reversal of population decline depended on male turtles mating with an increased number of females, or management actions to substantially increase the number of male hatchlings produced.},

	abstract = {Protected species bycatch can be rare, making it difﬁcult for ﬁshery managers to develop unbiased estimates of ﬁshing-induced mortality. To address this problem, we use Bayesian time-series models to estimate the bycatch of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), which have been documented only twice since 2002 by ﬁshery observers in the United States West Coast sableﬁsh pot ﬁshery, once in 2014 and once in 2016. This model-based approach minimizes under- and over-estimation associated with using ratio estimators based only on intra-annual data. Other opportunistic observations of humpback whale entanglements have been reported in United States waters, but, because of spatio-temporal biases in these observations, they cannot be directly incorporated into the models. Notably, the Bayesian framework generates posterior predictive distributions for unobserved entanglements in addition to estimates and associated uncertainty for observed entanglements. The United States National Marine Fisheries Service began using Bayesian time-series to estimate humpback whale bycatch in the United States West Coast sableﬁsh pot ﬁshery in 2019. That analysis resulted in estimates of humpback whale bycatch in the ﬁshery that exceeded the previously anticipated bycatch limits. Those results, in part, contributed to a review of humpback whale entanglements in this ﬁshery under the United States Endangered Species Act. Building on the humpback whale example, we illustrate how the Bayesian framework allows for a wide range of commonly used distributions for generalized linear models, making it applicable to a variety of data and problems. We present sensitivity analyses to test model assumptions, and we report on covariate approaches that could be used when sample sizes are larger. Fishery managers anywhere can use these models to analyze potential outcomes for management actions, develop bycatch estimates in data-limited contexts, and guide mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic gateway to the Arctic Ocean is influenced by vigorous inflows of Atlantic Water. The high-latitude impacts of these inflows have strengthened owing to climate change, particularly since 2000, driving so-called ‘Atlantification’ — a transition of Arctic waters to a state more closely resembling that of the Atlantic. In this Review, we discuss the physical and ecological manifestations of Atlantification in a hotspot region of climate change spanning the southern Barents Sea to the Eurasian Basin. Atlantification is driven by anomalous Atlantic Water inflows and is modulated by local processes, including: reduced atmospheric cooling, which amplifies warming in the southern Barents Sea; reduced freshwater input and stronger influence of ice import in the northern Barents Sea; and enhanced upper ocean mixing and air–ice–ocean coupling in the Eurasian Basin. Ecosystem responses to Atlantification encompass increased production, northward expansion of boreal species (borealization), an increased importance of the pelagic compartment populated by new species, an increasingly connected food web and a gradual reduction of the ice-a ssociated ecosystem compartment. Considering the complex evidence supporting Atlantification, dedicated, multidisciplinary observations and advanced modelling experiments targeting large-s cale changes in the system and specific mechanisms responsible for local and remote changes are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to ﬁt such models have been known for a long time: overﬁtting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overﬁtting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously aﬀects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a uniﬁed framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well deﬁned theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally diﬀerent, conﬁrming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates.

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of behavior is necessary to effectively manage the effects of human activities on wildlife, including vessel-based whale-watching. Yet, the wholly aquatic nature of cetaceans makes understanding their basic behavioral ecology quite challenging. An endangered population of killer whales faces several identified threats including prey availability and disturbance from vessels and sound. We used bio-logging tags that were temporally attached to individuals of the endangered Southern Resident killer whale population to more fully understand their subsurface behavior and to investigate vessel effects on behavior, including foraging behavior involving prey capture. We collected tag data over three field seasons in the waters surrounding the San Juan Islands, WA, United States, corresponding to the core summer area of the critical habitat of the population. Here, we used hidden Markov models to identify latent behavioral states that include characterization of different foraging states from sound and movement variables recorded by the multi-sensor tags. We tested a number of vessel variables (e.g., vessel counts, distance, and speed) on state transition probabilities, state occurrence and time spent within each behavioral state. Whales made fewer dives involving prey capture and spent less time in these dives when vessels had an average distance less than 400 yd (366 m). Additionally, we found both a sex and vessel distance effect on the state transition probabilities, suggesting that females and males respond differently to nearby vessels. Specifically, females were more likely to transition to a non-foraging state when vessels had an average distance less than 400 yd (366 m). A female’s decision to forego foraging states due to the close proximity of vessels could have cascading effects on the ability to meet energetic requirements to support reproductive efforts. This is particularly concerning in an endangered population that is in decline. Our findings, suggesting that female killer whales are at greater risk to close approaches by vessels, highlight the importance of understanding sex-specific responses to disturbance. These findings can inform future management decisions seeking to preserve foraging opportunities and enhance recovery efforts relevant to many cetacean species, including vulnerable and endangered populations.},

Five Queensland beaches support high-density nesting of this subpopulation, but egg and hatchling survival are low at some beaches because of feral and native terrestrial predators. We quantified predation of loggerhead turtle eggs by two species of goanna, Varanus panoptes and Varanus varius, at Wreck Rock beach, one of the turtle’s major nesting beaches. In addition, we conducted an experiment to determine the efficacy of a nest protection device. Predation rates at Wreck Rock beach were .\% for treatment and .\% for non-treatment clutches during the – nesting season. A higher probability of predation (\%) was predicted for the northern beach. Although nests were only partially predated (.\% of the total number of eggs), nest loss to predators and beach erosion (caused by a cyclone) was .\%. If left unmanaged, the cumulative impact of predation and other threats, including those exacerbated by climate change, can cause unsustainable loss of loggerhead turtle nests. This study provides one of the first quantitative data sets on rates of loggerhead turtle clutch predation in the South Pacific. It enhances our understanding of goanna predation impacts and identifies an efficient predator exclusion device for mitigating the effects of terrestrial predators at Wreck Rock beach, and for protecting marine turtle nests across northern Australia and globally.},

	abstract = {Predators must consume enough prey to support costly events, such as reproduction. Meeting high energetic requirements is particularly challenging for migrating baleen whales as their feeding seasons are typically restricted to a limited temporal window and marine prey are notoriously patchy. We assessed the energetic value of the six most common nearshore zooplankton species collected within the Oregon, United States range of the Paciﬁc Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) feeding grounds, and compared these results to the energetic value of the predominant amphipod species fed on by Eastern North Paciﬁc (ENP) gray whales in the Arctic. Energetic values of Oregon zooplankton differed signiﬁcantly between species (Kruskal–Wallis χ2 = 123.38, df = 5, p {\textless} 0.0001), with Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) megalopae displaying the highest mean caloric content of all tested species (4.21 ± 1.27 kJ g-1). This value, as well as the mean energetic value of the mysid Neomysis rayii (2.42 ± 1.06 kJ g-1), are higher than the mean caloric content of Ampelisca macrocephala, the predominant Arctic amphipod. Extrapolations of these results to daily energetic requirements of gray whales indicate that lactating and pregnant gray whales feeding in the PCFG range would require between 0.7–1.03 and 0.22–0.33 metric tons of prey less per day if they fed on Dungeness crab megalopae or N. rayii, respectively, than a whale feeding on A. macrocephala in the Arctic. Yet, these results do not account for differences in availability of these prey species to foraging gray whales. We therefore suggest that other factors, such as prey density, energetic costs of feeding, or natal philopatry and foraging site ﬁdelity play a role in the differences in population sizes between the PCFG and ENP gray whales. Climate change is implicated in causing reduced body condition and increased mortality of both PCFG and ENP gray whales due to decreased prey availability and abundance. Therefore, improved understanding of prey dynamics in response to environmental variability in both regions is critical.},

We used drumlines and longlines to determine shark community composition and habitat affinities in the Florida Keys, USA. Community composition varied among habitats. Catch rates of smaller sharks were highest in protected shallow waters, while large sharks were more abundant in deep channels. Overall probabilities of catching large sharks on drumlines did not vary with water temperature, while catches of small sharks on longlines increased with increasing water temperature. Individual species differed in their responsiveness to variation in water temperatures and habitat. Bait type affected catch rates of some species, suggesting that fishing methods should be considered explicitly in studies describing shark communities or temporal trends in abundance. Catch rates of large-bodied sharks were higher in a remote and protected location compared with similar habitats near inhabited Keys. Also, historical accounts of a shark fishery in the study area during the 1920s suggest substantial declines in large shark abundance and shifts in community composition. By implication, ecosystem impacts of changes in the large shark community may be dramatic and likely occurred before adequate baselines were established.},

	abstract = {In a warming climate, male sea turtles may become increasingly rare due to temperature-dependent sex determination with females being produced at warmer temperatures. Hence there is widespread concern that a lack of adult males may impact population viability. However, there is controversy over this scenario and here we review aspects of the biology of male sea turtles that will help mitigate female-biased hatchling sex ratios. In particular, there is strong evidence that males generally breed more frequently than females (i.e. have a shorter remigration interval) and that individual breeding males actively search for females and may mate with multiple females from different nesting sites. These aspects of the biology of male turtles will cause female-biased hatchling sex ratios to translate into more balanced adult sex ratios on the breeding grounds (i.e. operational sex ratios). Sexual dimorphism is widespread with adult male turtles generally being smaller than females. In freshwater turtles, this sexual dimorphism is linked to earlier age at maturity for males, although this possibility has not been examined widely in sea turtles. We make a forward-looking horizon-scanning prediction for key changes that might be expected at sea turtle breeding grounds if female-biased sex ratios become so extreme that male turtles start to become limiting and start driving populations to extinction. In particular, as the numbers of adult males on the breeding grounds become limiting there may be changes in egg fertility, multiple paternity and hatching success within clutches.},

              = 75 sites for seven species), we show that extreme female-biased hatchling sex ratios do not compromise population size and are the norm, with a tendency for populations to maximize the number of female hatchlings. Only at extremely high incubation temperature does high mortality within developing clutches threaten sea turtles. Our work shows how TSD itself is a robust strategy up to a point, but eventually high mortality and female-only hatchling production will cause extinction if incubation conditions warm considerably in the future.},

In the biodiverse Gulf of Mexico (GoM), recent telemetry studies highlighted post-nesting foraging sites for federally threatened loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). Our aim here was to discern loggerhead use of additional northern GoM regions that may serve as high-use foraging sites. Thus, we used satellite tracking and switching state-space modeling to show that the Big Bend region off the northwest Florida coast is a coastal foraging area that supports imperiled adult female loggerhead turtles tracked from different nesting subpopulations. From 2011 to 2016, we satellite-tagged 15 loggerheads that nested on four distinct beaches around the GoM: Dry Tortugas National Park, FL; Everglades National Park, FL; St. Joseph Peninsula, FL; and Gulf Shores, AL. Turtles arrived at their foraging ground in the Big Bend region between June and September and remained resident in their respective foraging sites for an average of 198 tracking days, where they established mean home ranges (95\% kernel density estimate) 232.7 km2. Larger home ranges were in deeper water; 50\% kernel density estimate centroid values were a mean 26.4 m deep and 52.7 km from shore. The Big Bend region provides a wide area of suitable yearround foraging habitat for loggerheads from at least 3 different nesting subpopulations. Understanding where and when threatened loggerheads forage and remain resident is key for designing both surveys of foraging resources and additional protection strategies that can impact population recovery trajectories for this imperiled species.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing tools are increasingly used for quantitative mapping of fluvial habitats, yet few techniques exist for continuous sampling of aquatic organisms, such as spawning salmonids. This study assessed the potential for spectrally based remote sensing of salmon spawning locations (i.e., redds) using data acquired from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) along a large, gravel-bed river. We developed a novel, semiautomated approach for detecting salmon redds by applying machine learning classification and object detection techniques to UAS-based imagery. We found that both true colour (RGB) and hyperspectral imagery could be used to identify salmon redds, though with varying degrees of accuracy. Redds were mapped with accuracies of  0.75 from RGB imagery using logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM) classification algorithms, but this type of data could not be used to identify redds using Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA). The hyperspectral imagery was more useful for mapping salmon redds, with accuracies greater than 0.9 for both logistic regression and SVM classifiers; OBIA of the hyperspectral data resulted in redd detection accuracies up to 0.86. The hyperspectral imagery also yielded complementary physical habitat information including water depth and substrate composition, which we quantified on the basis of a spectrally based chlorophyll absorption ratio. Overall, the hyperspectral imagery more effectively identified salmon spawning locations than RGB images and was more conducive to the classification approaches we evaluated. Each type of remotely sensed data had advantages and limitations, which are important for potential users to understand when incorporating UASbased data collection into river ecosystem studies.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the need to estimate the abundance of marine mammal populations to inform conservation assessments, especially relating to ﬁshery bycatch, this paper provides background on abundance estimation and reviews the various methods available for pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians. We ﬁrst give an “entrylevel” introduction to abundance estimation, including fundamental concepts and the importance of recognizing sources of bias and obtaining a measure of precision. Each of the primary methods available to estimate abundance of marine mammals is then described, including data collection and analysis, common challenges in implementation, and the assumptions made, violation of which can lead to bias. The main method for estimating pinniped abundance is extrapolation of counts of animals (pups or all-ages) on land or ice to the whole population. Cetacean and sirenian abundance is primarily estimated from transect surveys conducted from ships, small boats or aircraft. If individuals of a species can be recognized from natural markings, mark-recapture analysis of photo-identiﬁcation data can be used to estimate the number of animals using the study area. Throughout, we cite example studies that illustrate the methods described. To estimate the abundance of a marine mammal population, key issues include: deﬁning the population to be estimated, considering candidate methods based on strengths and weaknesses in relation to a range of logistical and practical issues, being aware of the resources required to collect and analyze the data, and understanding the assumptions made. We conclude with a discussion of some practical issues, given the various challenges that arise during implementation.},

Here, the ability of no-take zones (NTZs) to provide protection for legal-sized fish from targeted species within the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP) was assessed using both baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo-BRUV) and diver-operated stereo-video (stereo-DOV). The relative abundance of legal-sized individuals of three recreationally targeted fish species, spangled emperor Lethrinus nebulosus, chinaman cod Epinephelus rivulatus and goldspotted trevally Carangoides fulvoguttatus, were examined using both methodologies inside and outside six NTZs across the NMP. Stereo-BRUVs found positive effects of protection on the relative abundance of legal-size C. fulvoguttatus and L. nebulosus in NTZs. Stereo-DOVs, however, did not detect any differences in relative abundances and sizes of these species between areas opened and closed to fishing. These contrasting results suggest that choice of sampling methodology can influence interpretations of the ability of NTZs to provide adequate levels of protection for target species. Our results suggest that stereo-BRUVs are a superior technique to stereo-DOVs for assessing the effectiveness of no-take zones for protection of fishery target species, reflecting bait attraction and an absence of diver influence on fish behaviour.},

To date, organochlorines, genotype and infection with Otarine herpesvirus-1 (OtHV-1) have been identiﬁed in separate studies using distinct animals as associated with this carcinoma. Multi-year studies using large sample sizes to investigate the relative importance of multiple factors on marine mammal health are rare due to logistical and ethical challenges. The objective of this study was to use a case control approach with samples from 394 animals collected over 20 years in a multifactorial analysis to explore the relative importance of distinct factors identiﬁed to date as associated with sea lion cancer in the likelihood of sea lion carcinoma. Stepwise regression indicated that the best model to explain carcinoma occurrence included herpesvirus status, contaminant exposure, and blubber depth, but not genotype at a single microsatellite locus, PV11. The odds of carcinoma was 43.57 times higher in sea lions infected with OtHV-1 (95\% CI 14.61, 129.96, p {\textless} 0.001), and 1.48 times higher for every unit increase in the loge[contaminant concentrations], ng g−1 (an approximate tripling of concentration), in their blubber (95\% CI 1.11, 1.97, p {\textless} 0.007), after controlling for the effect of blubber depth. These ﬁndings demonstrate the importance of contaminant exposure combined with OtHV1 infection, in the potential for cancer occurrence in wild sea lions.},

Acoustic call counts recorded on an offshore hydrophone were highly variable from year to year. Assuming an average calling rate of 7.5 calls whale–1 d–1, the estimated number of whales migrating by this hydrophone would be {\textless}10\% of the population within 20 km of the offshore hydrophone in most years. In contrast, the estimated number of gray whales migrating off Santa Barbara and Los Angeles based on visual surveys grew at a greater rate (11\% yr−1 and 26\% yr−1, respectively) than the population size growth rate (5\% yr−1). Over the studied migration seasons it seems an increasing proportion of the population was using the nearshore migration corridor in the Southern California Bight, especially near Los Angeles. This trend could increase the negative anthropogenic impact on this species. Although several large-scale climatic events occurred between 2008 and 2015, neither water temperature in the Southern California Bight nor sea ice timing in the gray whale Arctic feeding area improved generalized additive models of gray whale nearshore sightings or offshore acoustic presence. Over these times, the gray whale migration timing appears to be driven more by their biological clock and instinct than by the extrinsic factors accounted for in the present analysis. Future work should test if other factors influence the gray whale migration over longer timescales.},

We conducted a longterm capture-mark-recapture program on nesting flatback turtles on Field Island in Kakadu National Park, a World Heritage Area that is jointly managed by Aboriginal landowners and the Australian Government, from 2002 to 2013 for between 12 and 20 monitoring days per year. We used a Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model that accounted for transience and recapture heterogeneity to estimate apparent survival and recapture probability, and estimated abundance using a Horvitz-Thompson type estimator. A total of 257 flatback turtles attempted nesting during that period, averaging 3.68 ± 0.28 (mean ± SE) nesting attempts per night of monitoring. Annual apparent survival of nesting flatback turtles was 0.97 (95\% CI = 0.94 to 0.98) and increased relative to body size. Recapture probability averaged 0.38 (95\% CI = 0.34 to 0.42) and was influenced by inter-annual climatic variability. The size of the Field Island nesting flatback turtle population ranged from 97 (95\% CI = 87 to 106) to 183 (95\% CI = 165 to 200) and there was a non-significant trend over 12 yr of monitoring. Understanding long-term population trends of nesting marine turtles is fundamental for management and recovery of these at-risk species.},

	abstract = {Understanding how populations are distributed spatially can be an effective tool for conservation and management planning. This is especially true for threatened species of mobile marine megafauna, which can use vast expanses of the ocean as foraging and reproductive habitat. Additionally, the broad distributions of these species expose them to a wide variety of threats across their range. Marine turtles are one of these mobile marine megafauna taxa, with individuals making extensive migrations between nesting beaches and foraging grounds. However, it is not well understood how many marine turtle populations distribute themselves spatially at the population or species level. In this study, 178 post-nesting female Kemp’s ridley sea turtles were concurrently satellite tracked from their primary and major secondary nesting beaches between 2010 and 2017 to determine population- and species-level distribution of females to foraging grounds. Filtered tracks and switching state-space models (SSMs) were used to determine the proportion of the adult female population dispersing to, and foraging in, the northern and southern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Fidelity to Gulf regions and foraging areas were also assessed. The majority of females dispersed to northern GoM (nGoM) foraging grounds indicating 82\% of the adult female population may use the region to forage. Additionally, individuals displayed ﬁdelity to regions, key foraging areas, and migratory corridors over time. These results suggest that the nGoM may provide the most important foraging areas for reproductively active females of the species and threats in the region may have a disproportionately higher impact on the adult female population, a population critical to the perpetuation and recovery of the species. Results highlight that continued bi-national recovery efforts are essential for recovery of Kemp’s ridleys, as most females nest on Mexican beaches and forage in U.S. waters. The methodologies used could be applied to conservation and management efforts of other imperiled mobile marine megafauna.},

Three active research fronts in null model analysis include biodiversity measures, species co-occurrence patterns, and macroecology. In the analysis of biodiversity, ecologists have used random sampling procedures such as rarefaction to adjust for differences in abundance and sampling effort. In the analysis of species co-occurrence and assembly rules, null models have been used to detect the signature of species interactions. However, controversy persists over the details of computer algorithms used for randomizing presence–absence matrices. Finally, in the newly emerging discipline of macroecology, null models can be used to identify constraining boundaries in bivariate scatterplots of variables such as body size, range size, and population density.

For this reason, populations of migratory species require careful monitoring to permit detection of any change in their conservation status. An easily implemented technique is a census of individuals at a particular location along the migratory route, which can be used as an index of population status. However, in most situations, censuses are only performed during a portion of a particular season, especially when the presence of the species spans several months at a remote place. To be able to make comparisons among years, it is, thus, important to correct for partial counts. Several such procedures have been developed recently for marine turtles at nesting sites, birds during migration and the phenology of flowering in plants. In the current paper, I review different existing approaches, and then present a new statistical framework improving on those previously used. The method was tested with various time-series of marine turtle nest counts during the nesting season. Results demonstrate that the method is very efficient, and has the additional advantage of being easy to use by a wide variety of researchers.},

Curved carapace length (CCL) in male and female olive ridleys reveals SSD, with males being larger than females. This large male SSD contrasts with the female-biased or absence of SSD commonly observed in sea turtles. The ultimate and proximate mechanisms potentially at play are discussed here and tested where possible. One of the main drivers of smaller female SSD could be egg production. We show that egg production in olive ridleys in the Congo is optimal for intermediate female CCL when corrected to nesting date. When females are longer, egg production decreases, probably because of the constrained three-dimensional volume. This counterintuitive relationship between CCL and egg production could be the driving force behind the unusual evolution of larger male SSD in olive ridley turtles, and ultimately, the small size of this species as compared to other marine turtles.},

            Climate-induced environmental changes are profoundly impacting marine ecosystems and altering species distribution worldwide. Migratory organisms, including sea turtles, are expected to be particularly sensitive to these variations. Here, we studied changes in the size structure and reproductive activity of loggerhead turtles in the French Mediterranean over 30 years. Overall, there was a significant increase in the size of observed loggerheads between 1990 and 2020. However, this increase was only significant during the breeding/nesting season (May to September) and was driven by the increased presence of adults. Furthermore, nesting activity along the French coast was detected in 2002 for the first time in more than 50 years, and has become frequent after 2014, with nests discovered every year. The number of eggs laid as well as incubation duration and success varied among sites but fell within the range reported at established Mediterranean nesting sites. These observations, along with recent reports of breeding activity and evidence of significant sea surface warming, suggest that the north-western Mediterranean basin has become increasingly suitable to loggerhead turtles. We postulate that this range expansion is the result of climate change and propose that emerging nesting activity in France should be closely monitored and guarded against human activities.},

Due to limited data, there is often considerable uncertainty about species’ habitat relationships and requirements. If the boundaries of a protected area are based on relationships estimated by a habitat model, effective management takes the uncertainty into account. The inclusion of uncertainty in the design of a hypothetical marine protected area is described for a coastal population of the long-beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis off Baja California, Mexico. Line-transect and depth data were combined in a hierarchical Bayesian model. Two possible management goals were considered: protecting 100 000 animals or protecting 60\% of the population. A precautionary approach was adopted, meaning that the management goal should be met with a high probability. The model estimated that a seaward boundary at 360 m would include 100 000 dolphins with a probability of 0.9. A conventional but less precautionary ‘best estimate’ boundary at 160 m would meet the management goal with a probability of 0.5. For the second goal of including 60\% of the population, the precautionary and non-precautionary depths were 210 and 170 m, respectively. Habitat models are useful for management, but management decisions based on such models should consider the uncertainty inherent in estimating parameters from data. Models which include the data observation process can improve inference about habitat relationships.},

	abstract = {Despite more than half a century of criticism, signiﬁcance testing continues to be used commonly by ecologists. Signiﬁcance tests are widely misused and misunderstood, and even when properly used, they are not very informative for most ecological data. Problems of misuse and misinterpretation include: (i) invalid logic; (ii) rote use; (iii) equating statistical signiﬁcance with biological importance; (iv) regarding the P-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true; (v) regarding the P-value as a measure of effect size; and (vi) regarding the P-value as a measure of evidence. Signiﬁcance tests are poorly suited for inference because they pose the wrong question. In addition, most null hypotheses in ecology are point hypotheses already known to be false, so whether they are rejected or not provides little additional understanding. Ecological data rarely ﬁt the controlled experimental setting for which signiﬁcance tests were developed. More satisfactory methods of inference assess the degree of support which data provide for hypotheses, measured in terms of information theory (model-based inference), likelihood ratios (likelihood inference) or probability (Bayesian inference). Modern statistical methods allow multiple data sets to be combined into a single likelihood framework, avoiding the loss of information that can occur when data are analyzed in separate steps. Inference based on signiﬁcance testing is compared with model-based, likelihood and Bayesian inference using data on an endangered porpoise, Phocoena sinus. All of the alternatives lead to greater understanding and improved inference than provided by a P-value and the associated statement of statistical signiﬁcance.},

Effective measures to mitigate and prevent marine plastic pollution require a thorough understanding of its origin and eventual fate. Several models have estimated that land-based sources are the main source of marine plastic pollution, although ﬁeld data to substantiate these estimates remain limited. Current methodologies to measure riverine plastic transport require the availability of infrastructure and accessible riverbanks, but, to obtain measurements on a higher spatial and temporal scale, new monitoring methods are required. This paper presents a new methodology for quantifying riverine plastic debris using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), including a ﬁrst application on Klang River, Malaysia. Additional plastic measurements were done in parallel with the UAV-based approach to make comparisons between the two methods. The spatiotemporal distribution of the plastics obtained with both methods show similar patterns and variations. With this, we show that UAV-based monitoring methods are a promising alternative for currently available approaches for monitoring riverine plastic transport, especially in remote and inaccessible areas.},

            Eastern gray whales’ distribution range and plasticity in feeding behavior complicates the understanding of critical life-history such as pregnancy and lactation. Our goal was to determine if females who experienced gestation, gave birth, and lactated their calves, assimilated a high proportion of benthic amphipods from the Bering Sea, which are considered the species’ main prey. We used Bayesian stable isotope mixing models to estimate the probability of contribution of food items sampled along the species’ distributional range, using isotopic data on amphipods from the Bering Sea, mysids from Vancouver Island, and amphipods and polychaetes from Ojo de Liebre Lagoon. We sampled epidermal tissue from lactating females (n = 25) and calves (n = 34) and analyzed their carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition. Model outcome indicated that benthic amphipods from the Bering Sea were not the primary food for the eastern gray whale. Each mother performed a different feeding strategy, and prey from Vancouver Island were generally as important as that from the Bering Sea. Moreover, model results indicate a constant use of Ojo de Liebre Lagoon as a feeding ground. Our results appear to agree with previous studies that report continuous feeding by females to satisfy certain physiological requirements (e.g., fatty acids omega-6) during migration and breeding time. Future investigations of the isotopic composition of all those prey items that could be assimilated by the eastern gray whale emerge as critical. Both historical and recent information, that would provide insights in the species feeding ecology under past and present environmental conditions, should be considered as equally important to establish conservation and management plans.},

              Eretmochelys imbricata
              ) are considered endangered globally and are rare in Hawai‘i. Remnant hawksbill nesting beaches were identified in Hawai‘i in the late 1980s and the primary sites have been monitored since that time. In this study we summarize all available hawksbill nesting activity around the Hawaiian Islands between 1988 and 2018, highlighting relevant demographic and geographic data for the species. Because monitoring effort varied substantially across space and time, we implemented a predictive modeling approach that accounted for varying effort to explore potential trends in annual number of nesting females and nests over time. Field monitoring efforts documented an annual average of 14 ± 4.3 (range: 5–26) nesting females and 48 ± 19.0 (range: 12–93) nests, with a cumulative total of 178 individual nesting females and 1,280 nests recorded across all years. Nesting has been documented on four Hawaiian Islands, with the overwhelming majority of nesting females (78.4\%) and nests (86.5\%) recorded at four beaches along the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. Recent monitoring (2018) at a beach on Moloka‘i Island revealed numbers similar to the most important beaches on Hawai‘i Island. Despite difficulty discerning obvious trends when looking solely at the raw tabulated numbers from field monitoring, our analysis suggests both the number of nesting females and nests have been positively trending since 2006, and this is supported by a higher percentage (57.1\% of annual cohorts) of neophyte (vs. remigrant) nesters over the second half of the monitoring timeframe. The masking of obvious trends in the tabulated numbers is likely due to decreased overall monitoring effort as a result of reduced funding in recent years, coupled with a shift in focal monitoring effort from the historical primary nesting site of Kamehame, to the more recently established nesting site of Pōhue. Although the positive trend is encouraging, our findings highlight the precarious state of hawksbills in Hawai‘i and the need to enhance monitoring across all sites to support more robust population assessments and management decision making.},

            Distribution models are needed to understand spatiotemporal patterns in cetacean occurrence and to mitigate anthropogenic impacts. Shipboard line-transect visual surveys are the standard method for estimating abundance and describing the distributions of cetacean populations. Ship-board surveys provide high spatial resolution but lack temporal resolution and seasonal coverage. Stationary passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) employs acoustic sensors to sample point locations nearly continuously, providing high temporal resolution in local habitats across days, seasons and years. To evaluate whether cross-platform data synthesis can improve distribution predictions, models were developed for Cuvier’s beaked whales, sperm whales, and Risso’s dolphins in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico using two different methods: generalized additive models and neural networks. Neural networks were able to learn unspecified interactions between drivers. Models that incorporated PAM datasets out-performed models trained on visual data alone, and joint models performed best in two out of three cases. The modeling results suggest that, when taken together, multiple species distribution models using a variety of data types may support conservation and management of Gulf of Mexico cetacean populations by improving the understanding of temporal and spatial species distribution trends.},

	abstract = {As the ventral-tail fluke catalogues used to study humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) increase in size, the time and cost involved with curation and manual photo-identification matching increases accordingly, and this is becoming a significant challenge for field researchers. In addition, misidentification errors in catalogue matching can seriously affect population dynamics parameter estimates and capture-mark recapture estimates of population size. In this study we used long-term photo-identification data, derived from an innovative matching system, which yielded a reconciled catalogue of 2,821 individual ventral-tail flukes and 578 resighting histories in Hervey Bay between 1992 and 2009. To investigate and examine the long-term stability and/or changes in natural marks on ventral-tail flukes, dorsal-fin shapes and lateral body marks, we used a subsample of 79 individual humpback whales, resighted in 2 to 11 years over timespans ranging from 2 to 21 years. A binary logistic mixed effects model was applied to a pair-matched sample of changes of marks in the 79 individual whales. The model found no significant difference between the proportion of changes in primary and secondary ventral tail fluke marks and the proportion of changes in primary dorsal-fin shape characteristics plus secondary lateral body marks (F = 0.939, df = 1/156, p = 0.334). The results of this study substantiate the value and reliability of using ventraltail flukes together with dorsal-fin shapes and lateral body marks, as multiple complementary tags in the photo-identification process. The data were used to discuss minimisation and management of misidentification errors in the photo-identification matching process, and the use of multiple complementary tags in the development of automated algorithm matching technology for white-dominant Southern Hemisphere humpback whale ventral-tail flukes.},

However, drone-based and boatbased survey methods have not been quantitatively compared for small, highly mobile cetaceans, such as Delphinidae. Here, we conduct paired concurrent boat-based and drone-based surveys, measuring the number of individuals in 21 groups and the behaviour within 13 groups of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). We additionally assessed the ability to detect behaviour events by the drone that would not be detectable from the boat. Drone-derived abundance counts detected 26.4\% more individuals per group on average than boat-based counts (p = 0.003). Drone-based behaviour observations detected travelling 55.2\% more frequently and association in subgroups 80.4\% more frequently than boat-based observations (p {\textless} 0.001 for both comparisons). Whereas foraging was recorded 58.3\% and resting 15.1\% less frequently by the drone than by boat-based surveys, respectively (p = 0.014 and 0.024). A considerable number of underwater behaviours ranging from individual play activities to intra- and inter-species interactions (including those with humans) were observed from the drone that could not be detected from the boat. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that drone surveys can improve the accuracy of population counts and behavioural data for small cetaceans and the magnitude of the discrepancies between the two methods highlights the need for cautious interpretation of studies that have relied on boat-derived data.},

A power plant had discharged heated effluent into the urbanized bay from 1960 to 2010. Straight carapace lengths of 101 Green Sea Turtles were recorded from 31 March 1990 to 15 April 2011 (45.4 to 110.4 cm). Green Sea Turtles in San Diego Bay were morphologically indistinguishable from those foraging in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The median growth rate was 1.03 cm/yr (21.6 to 11.4 cm/yr) for all turtles and was 4.9 cm/yr for turtles \#90 cm. These growth rates were one of the fastest for the species in temperate areas and comparable to those reported for tropical regions. The estimated growth parameter of the von Bertalanffy growth function (mean growth coefficient 5 0.21, 95\% posterior interval 5 0.19–0.23) also was greater than for other populations of Green Sea Turtles. Based on behavioral observations and information from other diet studies, we think that the altered environment from the power plant effluent affected the growth of the Green Sea Turtles directly (longer active periods) and via shifts in the environment (changes in prey composition, abundance, and distribution). With the termination of the power plant operation at the end of 2010, the ecosystem is reverting to its natural state, which we expect will result in decreased growth rates of these turtles in the coming years.},

The power plant, located in south San Diego Bay, California, USA, co-existed with a resident foraging aggregation of {\textasciitilde}60 green turtles for {\textasciitilde}50 yr. It was decommissioned during a long-term green turtle monitoring study, thus providing a rare opportunity to evaluate how the cessation of warm-water effluent affected turtle movements and habitat use in the area. During pre- and postdecommissioning of the power plant, 7 and 23 green turtles, respectively, were equipped with GPS-enabled satellite transmitters. Useful data were obtained from 17 turtles (4 for pre- and 13 for post-decommissioning). Core use areas (50\% utilization distribution [UD]) increased from 0.71 to 1.37 km2 after the power plant decommissioning. Increase in post-power plant 50\% UD was greater during nighttime (0.52 to 1.44 km2) than daytime (1.32 to 1.43 km2). Furthermore, UDs moved from the effluent channel to an area closer to seagrass pastures, a presumed foraging habitat of the turtles. The observed expansion of green turtle home ranges may increase turtle−human interactions, such as boat strikes, within the foraging ground; this underscores how seemingly innocuous human actions contribute to inadvertent consequences to wildlife. Possible management and conservation actions include increasing awareness of the public regarding turtle presence in the area through signage and education as well as legislating for a reduction in boat speeds in select areas of the bay.},

With expected changes in the ocean climate, understanding the relationship between species distributions and the environment is essential for developing successful management regulations. Here we provide information on an ephemeral but important habitat for North Paciﬁc loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) at the northeastern edge of their range. North Paciﬁc loggerhead turtles nest on Japanese beaches and juveniles disperse throughout the North Paciﬁc; some remain in the high seas of the central North Paciﬁc whereas others transition to the eastern Paciﬁc and forage near Baja California, Mexico. Loggerheads have also been reported along the United States west coast, with the majority of sightings off southern California. Here we describe their demography and distribution in the area, based on two aerial surveys (2011, 2015), at-sea sightings, and stranding records. Our aerial survey during fall 2015 determined density, abundance, and distribution of loggerheads in the area, when anomalous warming of the North Paciﬁc and El Niño conditions co-occurred. Using line-transect analysis, we estimated ca. 15,000 loggerheads at the sea surface (CV = 21\%) and more than 70,000 loggerheads when accounting for those that were submerged and not available for detection. Our survey during fall 2011 resulted in no loggerhead sightings, demonstrating a high variability of loggerhead density in the region. We encourage further research on loggerheads in the area to determine the mechanisms that promote their occurrence. These studies should include regular surveys throughout their foraging areas along the west coast of the North America as well as assessments of prey availability and local oceanographic conditions.},

Bayesian estimation of animal abundance for line-transect sampling. Biometrics 51, 1325–1337] by including a binomial likelihood function for the number of objects detected. The method computes a joint posterior distribution on the effective strip width and the density of objects in the sampled area. Analytical and computational methods for binned and unbinned perpendicular distance data are provided. Existing information about effective strip width and density can be brought into the analysis via prior distributions. The Bayesian approach is compared to a standard line-transect analysis using both real and simulated data. Results of the Bayesian and non-Bayesian analyses are similar when there are no prior data on effective strip width or density, but the Bayesian approach performs better when such data are available from previous or related studies. Practical methods for including prior data on effective strip width and density are suggested. A numerical example shows how the Bayesian approach can provide valid estimates when the sample size is too small for the standard approach to work reliably. The proposed Bayesian approach can form the basis for developing more advanced analyses.},

The mortality rate during the epizootic of 1987 and 1988 was calculated using the model. Sensitivity analyses indicated that precise estimates of natural and anthropogenic mortality rates were important for obtaining precise additional mortality rates during the die-off. For stranding data to be useful in this model, data should be collected in a consistent manner and effort within a defined area prior to, throughout, and after a die-off.

	abstract = {Peru’s coastal waters are characterized by signiﬁcant environmental ﬂuctuation due to periodic El Niño- La Niña- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. This variability results in ecosystem-wide food web changes which are reﬂected in the tissues of the Peruvian fur seal (Arctocephalus australis). Stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) in Peruvian fur seal vibrissae (whiskers) are used to infer temporal primary production and dietary variations in individuals. Sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) recordings from the Niño 1+2 Index region captured corresponding ENSO conditions. Fluctuations in δ15N values were correlated to SSTA records, indicating that ENSO conditions likely impact the diet of these apex predators over time. Anomalous warm phase temperatures corresponded to decreased δ15N values, whereas cold phase anomalous conditions corresponded to increased δ15N values, potentially from upwelled, nutrient-rich water. Vibrissae δ13C values revealed general stability from 2004 to 2012, a moderate decline during 2013 (La Niña conditions) followed by a period of increased values concurrent with the 2014–2016 El Niño event. Both δ13C and δ15N values were inversely correlated to each other during the strongest El Niño Southern Oscillation event on record (2014–2016), possibly indicating a decline in production leading to an increase in food web complexity. Lower δ13C and δ15N values were exhibited in female compared to male fur seal vibrissae. Findings suggest ENSO conditions inﬂuence resource availability, possibly eliciting changes in pinniped foraging behavior as well as food web of the endangered Peruvian fur seal.},

	abstract = {Deriving robust historical population trends for long-lived species subject to human exploitation is challenging in scenarios where long-term scientific data are scarce or unavailable, as often occurs for species affected by small-scale fisheries and subsistence hunting. The importance of Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) in data-poor scenarios is increasingly recognized in conservation, both in terms of uncovering historical trends and for engaging community stewardship of historic information. Building on previous work in marine historical ecology and local ecological knowledge, we propose a mixed socio-ecological framework to reliably document and quantify LEK to reconstruct historical population trends. Our method can be adapted by interdisciplinary teams to study various long-lived taxa with a history of human use. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by reconstructing long-term abundance data for the heavily-exploited East Pacific green turtle (
              Chelonia mydas
              ) in Baja California, Mexico, which was driven to near extinction by a largely unregulated fishery from the early 1950s to the 1980s. No scientific baseline abundance data were available for this time-frame because recent biological surveys started in 1995 after all green turtle fisheries in the area were closed. To fill this data gap, we documented LEK among local fishers using ethnographic methods and obtained verified, qualitative data to understand the socio-environmental complexity of the green turtle fishery. We then established an iterative framework to synthesize and quantify LEK using generalized linear models (GLMs) and nonlinear regression (NLR) to generate a standardized, LEK-derived catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) time-series. CPUE is an index of abundance that is compatible with contemporary scientific survey data. We confirmed the accuracy of LEK-derived CPUE estimates via comparisons with fisheries statistics available for 1962–1982. We then modeled LEK-derived abundance trends prior to 1995 using NLR. Our model established baseline abundance and described historical declines, revealing that the most critical (exponential) decline occurred between 1960 and 1980. This robust integration of LEK data with ecological science is of critical value for conservation and management, as it contributes to a holistic view of a species’ historic and contemporary conservation status.},

	abstract = {Understanding population structure and migration patterns is critical for conservation of marine species that undertake seasonal migrations, often spanning entire oceans, between breeding grounds and distant feeding areas. To examine the stock origin of the green turtle foraging aggregation in San Diego Bay, California, USA (32.6°N, 117.1°W) and evaluate current life history hypotheses, 770 bp sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 121 green turtles captured in San Diego Bay were compared to potential source (nesting) populations across the Pacific. Mixed stock analysis indicated that the San Diego Bay foraging population originates from eastern Pacific nesting sites, primarily the Revillagigedo Archipelago and the coast of Michoacán, Mexico. To further understand migratory pathways and breeding destinations, three mature female turtles were satellite tracked from the San Diego Bay foraging ground (FG), including one turtle tracked for 364 days that nested at Socorro Island in Revillagigedo and returned to San Diego Bay (total distance approx. 3200 km), one of the first continuous satellite tracks of a sea turtle from a FG to its nesting site and back. Tracks from another turtle indicated possible nesting at Tres Marias Islands, approximately 100 km off the Mexican mainland coast. All three turtles have subsequently been recaptured in San Diego Bay, indicating a high degree of FG philopatry. These results rule out previous speculation that Hawaiian green turtles were also using San Diego Bay, provide insights into the distribution of the Revillagigedo Islands and Michoacán breeding populations and draw attention to the Tres Marias Islands as a potential source of green turtles in the temperate North Pacific.},

	title = {Estimating gray whale abundance from shore-based counts using a multilevel {Bayesian} model},
	abstract = {Counts of southbound migrating whales off California form the basis of abundance estimation for the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Previous assessments (1967–2007) have estimated detection probability (p) from the detection-non detection of pods by two independent observers. However, tracking distinct pods in the field can be difficult for single observers; resulting in biased estimates of pod sizes that needed correcting, and matching observations of the same pod by both observers involved key assumptions. Due to these limitations, a new observation approach has been adopted wherein a paired team of observers work together and use a computerised mapping application to better track and enumerate distinct pods and tally the number of whales passing during watch periods. This approach has produced consistent counts over four recently monitored migrations (2006/7, 2007/8, 2009/10 and 2010/11), with an apparent increase in p compared to the previous method. To evaluate p and estimate abundance in these four years, counts from two independent stations of paired observers operating simultaneously were compared using a hierarchical Bayesian ‘N-mixture’ model to jointly estimate p and abundance without the challenge of matching pods between stations. The baseline detectability powas estimated as 0.80 (95\% Highest Posterior Density Interval [HPDI] = 0.75–0.85), which varied with observation conditions, observer effects and changes in whale abundance during the migration. Abundance changes were described using Bayesian model selection between a parametric model for a normally distributed common migration trend and a semi-parametric model that estimated the time trends independently for each year; the resultant migration curve was a weighted compromise between models, allowing for key departures from the common trend. The summed estimates of migration abundance ranged from 17,820 (95\% HPDI = 16,150–19,920) in 2007/08 to 21,210 (95\% HPDI = 19,420–23,230) in 2009/10, consistent with previous estimates and indicative of a stable population.},

	abstract = {Conventional aircraft have been used for photogrammetry studies of freeranging whales, but are often not practical in remote regions or not affordable. Here we report on the use of a small, unmanned hexacopter (APH-22; Aerial Imaging Solutions) as an alternative method for collecting photographs to measure killer whales (Orcinus orca) at sea. We deployed and retrieved the hexacopter by hand during 60 flights (average duration 13.2 min, max 15.7 min) from the upper deck of an 8.2 m boat, utilizing the aircraft’s vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability. The hexacopter was quiet and stable in flight, and therefore could be flown at relatively low altitudes without disturbing whales. The payload was a Micro Four-Thirds system camera that was used to obtain 18920 still images from an altitude of 35–40 m above the whales. Tests indicated a ground-resolved distance of {\textless}1.4 cm across the full extent of a flat and undistorted field of view, and an onboard pressure altimeter enabled measurements in pixels to be scaled to true size with an average accuracy of 5 cm. As a result, the images were sharp enough to differentiate individual whales using natural markings (77 whales in total) and preliminary estimates resolved differences in whale lengths ranging from 2.6 to 5.8 m. This first application at sea demonstrated the APH-22 hexacopter to be a safe and cost-effective platform for collecting photogrammetry images to fill key scientific data gaps about whales, and we anticipate this utility will extend to studies of other wildlife species.},

	abstract = {The ingestion of plastic by marine turtles is now reported for all species. Small juvenile turtles (including post-hatchling and oceanic juveniles) are thought to be most at risk, due to feeding preferences and overlap with areas of high plastic abundance. Their remote and dispersed life stage, however, results in limited access and assessments. Here, stranded and bycaught specimens from Queensland Australia, Paciﬁc Ocean (PO; n = 65; 1993–2019) and Western Australia, Indian Ocean (IO; n = 56; 2015–2019) provide a unique opportunity to assess the extent of plastic ({\textgreater} 1mm) ingestion in ﬁve species [green (Chelonia mydas), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), and ﬂatback turtles (Natator depressus)]. In the Paciﬁc Ocean, high incidence of ingestion occurred in green (83\%; n = 36), loggerhead (86\%; n = 7), ﬂatback (80\%; n = 10) and olive ridley turtles (29\%; n = 7). There was an overall lower incidence in IO; highest being in the ﬂatback (28\%; n = 18), the loggerhead (21\%; n = 14) and green (9\%; n = 22). No macroplastic debris ingestion was documented for hawksbill turtles in either site although sample sizes were smaller for this species (PO n = 5; IO n = 2). In the Paciﬁc Ocean, the majority of ingested debris was made up of hard fragments (mean of all species 52\%; species averages 46–97\%), whereas for the Indian Ocean these were ﬁlamentous plastics (52\%; 43–77\%). The most abundant colour for both sites across all species was clear (PO: 36\%; IO: 39\%), followed by white for PO (36\%) then green and blue for IO (16\%; 16\%). The polymers most commonly ingested by turtles in both oceans were polyethylene (PE; PO-58\%; IO-39\%) and polypropylene (PP; PO-20.2\%; IO-23.5\%). We frame the high occurrence of ingested plastic present in this marine turtle life stage as a potential evolutionary trap as they undertake their development in what are now some of the most polluted areas of the global oceans.},

This disruption is unprecedented in the modern era of global observing networks, pervasive sensing and large-scale tracking of human mobility and behaviour, creating a unique test bed for understanding the Earth System. In this Perspective, we hypothesize the immediate and long-term Earth System responses to COVID-19 along two multidisciplinary cascades: energy, emissions, climate and air quality; and poverty, globalization, food and biodiversity. While short-term impacts are dominated by direct effects arising from reduced human activity, longer-lasting impacts are likely to result from cascading effects of the economic recession on global poverty, green investment and human behaviour. These impacts offer the opportunity for novel insight, particularly with the careful deployment of targeted data collection, coordinated model experiments and solution-oriented randomized controlled trials, during and after the pandemic.},

The survey area was divided into southeast and south areas according to their oceanographic characteristics. Twenty-one species were observed in 503 sightings. The overall number of species was similar between the two areas, though it was higher in the spring in the south area. Five species were dominant and diversity varied more seasonally than spatially. ANOVA and kernel analyses showed that overall cetacean densities were higher in spring compared to autumn. Physeter macrocephalus, the most frequent species, concentrated throughout the south area at depths over 1000m in both seasons. Despite the overlapped occurrence at a broader scale, small delphinids presented latitudinal and in-offshore gradients as well as seasonal variation in distribution patterns, which could indicate habitat partitioning between some species. Delphinus delphis was only recorded in the south and its density decreased in areas where the presence of Stenella frontalis increased, mainly beyond the 250m isobath. Densities of S. longirostris and S. attenuata increased in lower latitudes and beyond the shelf break. The large delphinids Tursiops truncatus and Globicephala melas formed mixed groups in many occasions and were observed along the study area around depths of 500m. Grampus griseus was twice as frequent in the south area and densities increased in waters deeper than 600m. As expected, densities of both small and large migratory whales were higher during spring, over the continental slope, in the southeast area. The results presented here provided strong evidence on the importance of the outer continental shelf and slope to a diverse community of cetaceans occurring in the subtropical Southwestern Atlantic.},

Image scale is established via an independently powered LIDAR/GPS data-logging system recording altitude and GPS location at 1 Hz. Photogrammetric calibration of the camera and lens allowed distortion parameters to be rigorously accounted for during image analysis, via a custom-programmed Graphical User Interface (GUI) running in MATLAB. The datalogger, camera calibration methods and measurement software are adaptable to a wide range of UAV platforms. Mean LIDAR accuracy, measured from 10 bridges 9–39 m above water, was 99.9\%. We conducted 136 ﬂights in New Zealand’s subantarctic Auckland Islands to measure southern right whales. Mean lengths of 10 individual whales, each photographed between 7 and 15 times, had CVs (SD/mean) ranging from 0.5 to 1.8\% (mean = 1.2\%). Repeated measurements of a ﬂoating reference target showed a mean error of c.1\%. Our system is relatively inexpensive, easily put together, produces accurate, repeatable measurements from single vertical images, and hence is applicable to a wide range of ecological questions in marine and terrestrial habitats.},

	abstract = {Human actions led to the worldwide decline of marine mammal populations in the 18th–19th centuries. Global adoption of protective legislation during the 20th century has recently allowed many marine mammal pop­ ulations to recover. This positive trend is particularly true of pinnipeds (e.g., seals and sea lions), whose recovering populations are increasingly in conflict with fisheries. Fisheries organisations have called for managed culls of sea lion populations to reduce competition for target fish species as well as damage to catch and fishing gear through operational interactions. However, despite widespread perceptions that sea lion populations are generally increasing, to-date, culls have often been considered or implemented without quantitative evidence of their impacts on seal lion population viability. This knowledge gap is particularly concerning given the expected increase in extreme climate conditions, such as extreme El Nin˜o events, which together with culls could push sea lion populations in some parts of the world into the extinction vortex. Here, I develop stochastic matrix popu­ lation models of the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) parameterised through a combination of speciesspecific field data and phylogenetic imputation using data from related species in the COMADRE animal matrix database. Using these models, I project the impact of (1) three cull scenarios with different intensity and tem­ poral frequency targeting adult females, (2) extreme El Nin˜o events whose frequency is modelled using a Markovian transition matrix, and (3) the interaction of culls and extreme climate events on population dynamics. I focus on the Chilean population of O. flavescens, where recent increases in sea lion numbers have triggered widespread conflict with small-scale fisheries, and where sea lion populations will increasingly be affected by extreme El Nin˜o conditions. I find that sea lion populations decline below minimum viable population sizes within 16–28 years under all scenarios involving culls and extreme climate events. This research explicitly in­ corporates parameter uncertainty into population projections—in so doing, it illustrates the need for future research to collect stage-specific, annual population data to reduce uncertainty regarding marine mammal vital rates.},

	abstract = {There were 717 cetacean strandings recorded in San Diego County, California, USA between 1851 and 2008. These strandings comprised 18 odontocete and 6 mysticete species. Common dolphins (both the short-beaked (Delphinus delphis) and long-beaked common dolphin (D. capensis)) were the most commonly stranded cetacean species (43.2\%), followed by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) (16.5\%), gray whales (Eschrictius robustus) (11.0\%), and Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhyncus obliquidens) (7.0\%). A higher number of strandings was observed in the La Jolla and Coronado/Imperial Beach areas, which likely reflects the influence of coastal protrusions in those regions. Strandings of bottlenose dolphin neonates suggests their calving season extends from May to September. Strandings of common dolphin species peaked in the early- to mid-1970s and in the late-1990s to 2008, coincident with cool oceanographic regimes. In addition, extralimital strandings of harbour porpoises and temporal changes in stranding rates of Dall’s porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli) and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) may have been associated with changes in oceanographic conditions. Evidence of human interaction in strandings included entanglements, boat strikes, shootings and harpooning. Overall, the stranding record largely reflected the species composition of the Southern California Bight and provided confirmation for presence of cryptic species not previously recorded by aerial and ship surveys.},

	abstract = {High correlation among predictors has long been an annoyance in regression analysis. The crux of the problem is that the linear regression model assumes each predictor has an independent effect on the response that can be encapsulated in the predictor’s regression coefﬁcient. When predictors are highly correlated, the data do not contain much information on the independent effects of each predictor. The high correlation among predictors can result in large standard errors for the regression coefﬁcients and coefﬁcients with signs opposite of what is expected based on a priori, subject-matter theory. We propose a Bayesian model that accounts for correlation among the predictors by simultaneously performing selection and clustering of the predictors. Our model combines a Dirichlet process prior and a variable selection prior for the regression coefﬁcients. In our model highly correlated predictors can be grouped together by setting their corresponding coefﬁcients exactly equal. Similarly, redundant predictors can be removed from the model through the variable selection component of our prior. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our method through simulation studies and analysis of real data.},

	abstract = {In the Gulf of Mexico, the bulk of published studies for sea turtles have focused on northern (United States) waters where economic resources are centered, with fewer studies in the southern portion of the basin, resulting in signiﬁcant knowledge gaps in these underrepresented areas. Similarly, publications on adult sea turtles are dominated by research on females that come ashore to nest and can be readily studied (e.g., through the collection of biological samples and the application of satellite-telemetry devices), whereas information on adult male sea turtles is scarce. The goal of this paper is to begin ﬁlling these knowledge gaps by synthesizing available data on adult male sea turtles in the southern Gulf of Mexico. We used satellite-telemetry, boat- and dronebased surveys, and stranding records combined with ocean circulation modeling to better understand the spatial distribution of male loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and Kemp’s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) sea turtles in the southern Gulf of Mexico. These spatially explicit analyses will provide context for opportunistically collected data on male sea turtles and better contribute to the management and restoration of sea turtle populations that use the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, this synthesis can serve as a launching point for directed studies on male sea turtles in this region.},

	abstract = {Spatial management for highly migratory species (HMS) is difficult due to many species’ mobile habits and the dynamic nature of oceanic habitats. Current static spatial management areas for fisheries in the United States have been in place for extended periods of time with limited data collection inside the areas, making any analysis of their efficacy challenging. Spatial modeling approaches can be specifically designed to integrate species data from outside of closed areas to project species distributions inside and outside closed areas relative to the fishery. We developed HMS-PRedictive Spatial Modeling (PRiSM), which uses fishery-dependent observer data of species’ presence–absence, oceanographic covariates, and gear covariates in a generalized additive model (GAM) framework to produce fishery interaction spatial models. Species fishery interaction distributions were generated monthly within the domain of two HMS longline fisheries and used to produce a series of performance metrics for HMS closed areas. PRiSM was tested on bycatch species, including shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), billfish (Istiophoridae), and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) in a pelagic longline fishery, and sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), dusky shark (C. obscurus), and scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) in a bottom longline fishery. Model validation procedures suggest PRiSM performed well for these species. The closed area performance metrics provided an objective and flexible framework to compare distributions between closed and open areas under recent environmental conditions. Fisheries managers can use the metrics generated by PRiSM to supplement other streams of information and guide spatial management decisions to support sustainable fisheries.},

	abstract = {Green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, are known to inhabit populated and often urbanized areas. To understand turtle habitat use and behavior within these unique habitats, seven juvenile green turtles were ﬁtted with acoustic transmitters (September 2012 –August 2014), of which two transmitters included an accelerometer (AP transmitter). One individual ﬁtted with an AP transmitter was tracked using a passive acoustic array in an urbanized river, the San Gabriel River, Long Beach, CA (33◦45’ N, 118◦05’ W). Three additional turtles in this river and three turtles (one with AP transmitter) in a restored estuary (33◦44’ N, 118◦03’ W) in southern California were actively tracked for two nonconsecutive 24-h periods. Those ﬁtted with AP transmitters indicated that turtles were less active at night (0.58 ± 0.56 m/s2 and 0.50 ± 0.63 m/s2) than during the day (0.86 ± 0.63 m/s2 and 0.78 ± 0.60 m/s2) at both sites. Activity data and corresponding movements of the actively tracked turtle ﬁtted with the AP transmitter were used to infer resting periods for other tracked individuals. Turtles rested near bridge pilings and runoff outﬂows in the river to potentially shelter from tidal ﬂow. Turtles used signiﬁcantly larger daily areas in the urbanized river (0.046 ± 0.023 km2) where resources may be patchier and less abundant, compared to turtles in the estuary (0.024 ± 0.012 km2) where large, dense eelgrass beds are present. Based on the habitat use and behaviors of green sea turtles, it appears that some green sea turtles are able to make use of both highly developed and restored habitats and likely beneﬁt from certain aspects of development.},

Green sea turtles (GSTs) Chelonia mydas are an ectothermic species observed inhabiting 2 sites with AAWT at the northern point of their geographical range in the eastern Pacific. An acoustic receiver array was deployed with temperature loggers at the San Gabriel River, Long Beach, CA, where 2 power plants discharge warm water into the river, and at the 7th St. Basin, Seal Beach, CA, a dredged shallow basin with warmer water compared to surrounding coastal habitats during the summer months. Juvenile GSTs (n = 22, straight carapace length = 45.2 to 96.8 cm) were tagged with acoustic transmitters. Turtles in the basin migrated into the river during winter months when temperatures dropped below 15°C. During the winter, turtles were most frequently detected at the river receiver stations adjacent to and downstream of the power plants. This suggests that GSTs use the warm effluent as a thermal refuge, avoiding colder areas upstream of the power plants and near the river mouth. In the summer, turtles were most frequently detected at receiver stations upstream of the power plants, potentially exploiting areas of the river with higher primary productivity. AAWT sustain the northernmost aggregation of GSTs in the eastern Pacific year round; however, based on GST thermal tolerance, this population is expected to change their movement patterns when the power plants discontinue discharging warm water by 2029.},

Based on size alone, 40\% of existing MPAs could encompass the home ranges of the smallest ranged species, while only \&lt; 1\% of existing MPAs could encompass those of the largest ranged species. Further, where home ranges and MPAs overlapped in real geographic space, MPAs encompassed \&lt; 5\% of core areas used by all species. Despite most home ranges of mobile marine megafauna being much larger than existing MPAs, we demonstrate how benefits from MPAs are still likely to accrue by targeting seasonal aggregations and critical life history stages and through other management techniques.},

In this study, we used historical memories of Sicilian ﬁshers to understand their perception of change in abundance of cartilaginous ﬁsh in the Strait of Sicily over the last decades. We conducted interviews with 27 retired ﬁshers from Mazara del Vallo harbor (SW Sicily) working in demersal ﬁsheries, using a pre-deﬁned questionnaire with a series of open and ﬁxed questions related to the abundance of sharks and rays. The questionnaire included speciﬁc questions about the trends they perceived in catch or by-catch of cartilaginous ﬁsh abundance between the 1940s and 2000s compared to the present. Information was gathered for 18 species, including Carcharhinidae, mesopredatory demersal sharks (Squalidae, Hexanchidae, Centrophoridae, Oxynotidae, Triakidae, Scyliorhinidae, and Squatinidae) and batoids. Overall shark catches were perceived to have diminished since the early 1940s: about 95\% of ﬁshers reported the decline of commercially important species (e.g., Mustelus spp.) and indicated species that could have been depleted or locally extinct (e.g., Squatina spp., Sphyrna lewini, Mustelus asterias, etc.). Our study shows that LEK of ﬁshers can be beneﬁcial for reconstructing long-term population trends of exploited species when traditional standard data on ﬁsheries catch or species relative abundance from surveys is limited or only available for recent periods. The results obtained clearly indicate the rapid and alarming decline of elasmobranchs in the Strait of Sicily highlighting the need for urgent conservation measures to be adopted.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest from research and conservation groups in the potential for using small unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs; {\textless}2 kg) to conduct wildlife surveys because they are affordable, easy to use, readily available and reliable. However, limitations such as short ﬂight endurance, and in many situations, aviation regulations, have constrained the use of small UAVs in survey applications. Thus, there is a need to reﬁne survey methods adapted to small UAVs that conform to standard operations within aviation law. We developed a novel survey approach based on a grid sampling design using two multirotor UAVs (Phantom 4 Pros) ﬂying simultaneously, within visual line of sight, from our vessel base-station. We used this approach to assess the ﬁnescale distribution and abundance of dugongs (Dugong dugon) in the remote waters of the Pilbara, Western Australia during three ﬁeld seasons across 2 years. We surveyed 64 non-overlapping survey cells in random order one or more times and obtained complete image coverage of each surveyed cell of our 31 km2 survey area. Our sampling design maximizes sampling effort while limiting survey time by surveying four cells, two at a time, from one location. Overall, we conducted 240 ﬂights with up to 17 ﬂights per day (mean = 14 ﬂights per day) and could obtain complete coverage of up to 11.36 km2per day. A total of 149 dugongs were sighted within the 50,482 images which we manually reviewed. Spatially-explicit models of dugong density distribution (corrected for availability and perception bias) were produced using general additive models to identify areas more or less used by dugongs (range of corrected dugong densities across all ﬁeld season = 0.002–1.79 dugongs per 0.04 km2). Dugong abundance estimates ranged from 47 individuals in June 2019 (CV = 0.17) to 103 individuals in May 2018 (CV = 0.36). Our method, which proved convincing in a real-word application by its feasibility, ease of implementation, and achievable surface coverage has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications from community-based local-scale surveys, to long-term repeated/intensive surveys, and impact assessments and environmental monitoring studies.},

	abstract = {The study of cetacean strandings was globally recognised as a priority topic at the 2019 World Marine Mammal Conference, in recognition of its importance for understanding the threats to cetacean communities and, more broadly, the threats to ecosystem and human health. Rising multifaceted anthropogenic and environmental threats across the globe, as well as whale population recovery from exploitation in some areas, are likely to coincide with an increase in reported strandings. However, the current methods to monitor strandings are inherently biased towards populated coastlines, highlighting the need for additional surveying tools in remote regions. Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery offers the prospect of upscaling monitoring of mass strandings in minimally populated/unpopulated and inaccessible areas, over broad spatial and temporal scales, supporting and informing intervention on the ground, and can be used to retrospectively analyse historical stranding events. Here we (1) compile global strandings information to identify the current data gaps; (2) discuss the opportunities and challenges of using VHR satellite imagery to monitor strandings using the case study of the largest known baleen whale mass stranding event (3) consider where satellites hold the greatest potential for monitoring strandings remotely and; (4) outline a roadmap for satellite monitoring. To utilise this platform to monitor mass strandings over global scales, considerable technical, practical and environmental challenges need to be addressed and there needs to be inclusivity in opportunity from the onset, through knowledge sharing and equality of access to imagery.},

We used skeletochronological data on humerus diameter growth changes to estimate the age of North Paciﬁc olive ridley seaturtles caught incidentally by pelagic longline ﬁsheries operating near Hawaii and from dead turtles washed ashore on the main Hawaiian Islands. Two age estimation methods [ranking, correction factor (CF)] were used and yielded age estimates ranging from 5 to 38 and 7 to 24 years, respectively. Rank age-estimates are highly correlated (r ¼ 0.93) with straight carapace length (SCL), CF age estimates are not (r ¼ 0.62). We consider the CF age-estimates as biologically more plausible because of the disassociation of age and size. Using the CF age-estimates, we then estimate the median age at sexual maturity to be around 13 years old (mean carapace size c. 60 cm SCL) and found that somatic growth was negligible by 15 years of age. The expected age-speciﬁc growth rate function derived using numerical differentiation suggests at least one juvenile growth spurt at about 10–12 years of age when maximum age-speciﬁc growth rates, c. 5 cm SCL year)1, are apparent.},

Gross pathology in the lungs suggestive of drowning was seen in 23 of 71 turtles. Considering only the external gross findings, the pathologist and the observer on board the longline vessel agreed on hook-induced lesions only 60\% of the time thereby illustrating the limitations of depending on external examination alone to implicate hooking interactions or drowning as potential cause of sea turtle mortality. When comparing histology of drowned turtles to a control group of nondrowned turtles, the former had significantly more pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and sloughed columnar epithelium. These microscopic changes may prove useful to diagnose suspected drowning in sea turtles where history of hooking or netting interactions is unknown.},

	abstract = {The BUGS language oﬀers a very ﬂexible way of specifying complex statistical models for the purposes of Gibbs sampling, while its JAGS variant oﬀers very convenient R integration via the rjags package. However, including smoothers in JAGS models can involve some quite tedious coding, especially for multivariate or adaptive smoothers. Further, if an additive smooth structure is required then some care is needed, in order to centre smooths appropriately, and to ﬁnd appropriate starting values. R package mgcv implements a wide range of smoothers, all in a manner appropriate for inclusion in JAGS code, and automates centring and other smooth setup tasks. The purpose of this note is to describe an interface between mgcv and JAGS, based around an R function, jagam, which takes a generalized additive model (GAM) as speciﬁed in mgcv and automatically generates the JAGS model code and data required for inference about the model via Gibbs sampling. Although the auto-generated JAGS code can be run as is, the expectation is that the user would wish to modify it in order to add complex stochastic model components readily speciﬁed in JAGS. A simple interface is also provided for visualisation and further inference about the estimated smooth components using standard mgcv functionality. The methods described here will be un-necessarily ineﬃcient if all that is required is fully Bayesian inference about a standard GAM, rather than the full ﬂexibility of JAGS. In that case the BayesX package would be more eﬃcient.},

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are highly toxic and persistent aquatic pollutants that are known to bio­ accumulate in a variety of marine mammals. They have been associated with reduced recruitment rates and population declines in multiple species. Evidence to date documents effects of PCB exposures on female repro­ duction, but few studies have investigated whether PCB exposure impacts male fertility. Using blubber tissue samples of 99 adult and 168 juvenile UK-stranded harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) collected between 1991 and 2017, here we show that PCBs exposures are associated with reduced testes weights in adults with good body condition. In animals with poor body condition, however, the impact of PCBs on testes weights was reduced, conceivably due to testes weights being limited by nutritional stress. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between PCB contaminant burden and testes weights in cetaceans and represents a substantial advance in our understanding of the relationship between PCB exposures and male reproductive biology in cetaceans. As testes weight is a strong indicator of male fertility in seasonally breeding mammals, we suggest the inclusion of such effects in population level impact assessments involving PCB exposures. Given the re-emergent PCB threat our findings are globally significant, with potentially serious implications for long-lived mammals. We show that more effective PCB controls could have a substantial impact on the reproductive health of coastal cetacean species and that management actions may need to be escalated to ensure adequate protection of the most vulnerable cetacean populations.},

	abstract = {Recent dramatic reductions of winter sea ice in the northern Bering Sea have raised the possibility that a rapid ecological transformation is underway. It has been hypothesized that with sufficient sea ice loss the cold pool thermal barrier separating the northern and southern Bering Sea would be breached, potentially benefiting piscivorous seabirds with an influx of abundant forage fish, but maybe causing food limitations for planktivorous seabirds that rely on cold-water associated species of zooplankton. During 2016–2019, we examined responses of the seabird community breeding on St. Lawrence Island to variable winter sea ice extent (low in 2018–2019). The seabird community includes piscivorous black-legged kittiwakes, thick-billed and common murres, and plank­ tivorous crested and least auklets. We used a combination of stable isotope analysis and nutritional stress status analyses to examine if the region’s ecosystem has shifted to a pelagic prey base, and whether either foraging guild benefitted from such a shift. To interpret bird responses, we used stable isotope analyses of prey and trawl survey-derived abundance of forage size fish. Stable isotope values in blood tissues revealed no change in the prey base as reflected in the isotopic space used by the seabird community across the four study years. Sea-ice loss was, however, associated with increased nutritional stress in all seabird species and diverging foraging niches within guilds. Benthic forage-sized fish remained a key food source, with their abundance stable since 2010, and benthic-foraging thick-billed murres experienced relatively low nutritional stress across the study period. A significant increase in common murre nutritional stress levels between 2016 and 2017, and a shift in their isotopic niche indicative of higher reliance on benthic prey coincided with a decline in the abundance of pelagic forage fish in the region. Surface-foraging black-legged kittiwakes experienced steady increases in nutritional stress as the abundance of pelagic forage fish declined. The spring sea-ice loss was detrimental to planktivorous least and crested auklets that rely on zooplankton advected from the Bering Sea basin. During the study period both auklets have experienced severe nutritional stress (2018) and colony-wide reproductive fail­ ures (2018 and 2019). In conclusion, we found that increasingly warm conditions during 2016–2019 have challenged the adaptive ability of seabirds relying on pelagic fish and zooplankton advected into the region each summer, but have not yet resulted in a reorganization of the northern Bering Sea’s benthic-dominated ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Extreme climatic events are expected to become more frequent under current conditions of increasing global temperatures and climate variability. A key challenge of ﬁsheries management is understanding and planning for the eﬀect of anomalous oceanic conditions on the distributions of protected species and their interactions with ﬁshing gear. Atypical marine states can cause non-target species to shift outside of their normal distribution patterns, leading to unwanted bycatch events that threaten ﬁsheries sustainability. Environmental indicators can serve as early warning signals that allow for proactive management responses before signiﬁcant bycatch occurs. Marine heatwaves in the Paciﬁc have caused shifts in the distributions of endangered loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), increasing overlap with California’s Drift Gillnet ﬁshery and thereby the risk of turtle bycatch events. To reduce bycatch, a ﬁshery closure oﬀshore of Southern California – The Loggerhead Conservation Area – Is enacted when an El Niño event has been declared and local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are warmer than normal. However, this regulation was based on qualitative assessment of bycatch that occurred during past El Niño events, and no explicit threshold for SST anomalies was deﬁned. Additionally, closures enacted under the current regulation rely on structured expert decision-making. Providing a quantitative indicator could help to reﬁne future decisions. We developed and evaluated potential new indicators to guide the Loggerhead Conservation Area closure timing based on thermal indices in three diﬀerent regions: the equatorial Paciﬁc, regional areas oﬀshore of Southern California, and temperate pelagic areas oﬀ the US west coast. Our objectives were to: 1) quantify thermal indicators and their respective thresholds to guide closure timing, and 2) hindcast closure scenarios based on these indicator thresholds to evaluate eﬃcacy in terms of opportunity costs to ﬁshers and ability to avoid turtle interactions. The best indicator in terms of avoiding historical turtle interactions while minimizing opportunity cost to ﬁshers was a six-month average local SST anomaly indicator with closures enacted above a threshold of 0.77 °C. This result can improve upon the current closure guidelines by providing a quantiﬁed and spatially-explicit indicator and threshold to supplement the structured decision-making process. Our analysis demonstrates a novel approach to developing ﬁsheries management strategies for species with a paucity of data. Issues with data comprehensiveness are frequently present in ﬁsheries management exercises, and precautionary approaches are needed to allow adherence with legislation while considering the best available science.},

A key part of this role is to reduce the eﬀects of ﬁsheries on bycatch of vulnerable species. Bycatch can have an impact on species by reducing population sizes, and an ecosystem-level impact through the signiﬁcant removal of biomass and subsequent trophic changes. In this regard, it is crucial to reﬁne methods for quantifying interactions between ﬁsheries and bycatch species, and to manage these interactions spatially. A new method is presented for quantifying interactions between ﬁsheries and bycatch species at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Temporally explicit species distribution models are used to examine temporal dynamics of ﬁsheries and bycatch. This method is applied to Australia’s Eastern Tuna and Billﬁsh Fishery to estimate interactions with seven principal bycatch species. The ability of MPAs to reduce bycatch is evaluated, and considerations are outlined for the spatial management of ﬁshery-bycatch species interactions. Australia’s Commonwealth Marine Reserve Network had a minimal impact on bycatch reduction under both the 2012 proclaimed and the 2015 panelrecommended zonings. These results highlight the need for threats to marine biodiversity to be incorporated directly into design of MPAs, and for close scrutiny of assumptions that threats will be incidentally abated after MPAs have been proclaimed, or that oﬀ-reserve mechanisms will compensate for inadequacies of MPAs.},

	abstract = {Bycatch in marine ﬁsheries is the leading source of human-caused mortality for marine mammals, has contributed to substantial declines of many marine mammal populations and species, and the extinction of at least one. Schemes for evaluating marine mammal bycatch largely rely on estimates of abundance and bycatch, which are needed for calculating biological reference points and for determining conservation status. However, obtaining these estimates is resource intensive and takes careful longterm planning. The need for assessments of marine mammal bycatch in ﬁsheries is expected to increase worldwide due to the recently implemented Import Provisions of the United States Marine Mammal Protection Act. Managers and other stakeholders need reliable, standardized methods for collecting data to estimate abundance and bycatch rates. In some cases, managers will be starting with little or no data and no system in place to collect data. We outline a comprehensive framework for managing bycatch of marine mammals. We describe and provide guidance on (1) planning for an assessment of bycatch, (2) collecting appropriate data (e.g., abundance and bycatch estimates), (3) assessing bycatch and calculating reference points, and (4) using the results of the assessment to guide marine mammal bycatch reduction. We also provide a brief overview of available mitigation techniques to reduce marine mammal bycatch in various ﬁsheries. This paper provides information for scientists and resource managers in the hope that it will lead to new or improved programs for assessing marine mammal bycatch, establishing best practices, and enhancing marine mammal conservation globally.},

	abstract = {A simulation method was developed for identifying populations with levels of human-caused mortality that could lead to depletion, taking into account the uncertainty of available information. A mortality limit (termed the Potential Biological Removal, PBR, under the US. Marine Mammal Protection Act) was calculated as the product of a minimum population estimate (NMIN), one-half of the maximum net productivity rate (RMAX),and a recovery factor (F,). Mortality limits were evaluated based on whether at least 95\% of the simulated populations met two criteria: (1) that populations starting at the maximum net productivity level (MNPL)stayed there or above after 20 yr, and (2) that populations starting at 30\% of carrying-capacity ( K ) recovered to at least MNPL after 100 yr. Simulations of populations that experienced mortality equal to the PBR indicated that using approximately the 20th percentile (the lower 60\% log-normal confidence limit) of the abundance estimate for N M r Nmet the criteria for both cetaceans (assuming RMAX= 0.04) and pinnipeds (assuming RMAx= 0.12). Additional simulations that included plausible levels of bias in the available information indicated that using a value of 0.5 for F , would meet both criteria during these “bias trials.” It is concluded that any marine mammal population with an estimate of humancaused mortality that is greater than its PBR has a level of mortality that could lead to the depletion of the population. The simulation methods were also used to show how mortality limits could be calculated to meet conservation goals other than the US. goal of maintaining populations above MNPL.},

	abstract = {Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes’ theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a major goal in the next decade.},

We used a combination of molecular tools to examine the potential physiological impacts of HOC exposure in two bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) ecotypes in the SCB. We quantiﬁed 25 HOCs in the blubber of 22 biopsies collected from males between 2012 and 2016. We then analyzed genome-wide gene expression in skin using RNA-sequencing and measured blubber testosterone to compare HOC exposure with cellular and endocrine biomarkers. We found high levels of HOCs in both ecotypes with signiﬁcantly higher total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH), and chlordane-related compounds in the coastal ecotype versus the oﬀshore ecotype. We found evidence of PBDE bioaccumulation in both ecotypes, however, the pattern of bioaccumulation or endocrine disruption for other HOCs was diﬀerent between the ecotypes, suggesting potential endocrine disruption in the coastal ecotype. We also observed correlations between HOCs and gene coexpression networks enriched for xenobiotic metabolism, hormone metabolism, and immune response that could indicate cellular eﬀects from HOC exposure. By integrating measurements of HOC load with both transcriptome proﬁling and endocrine biomarkers, our approach provides insight into HOC exposure and potential impacts on wild cetacean health in southern California.},

	abstract = {Climate change is a global phenomenon, yet impacts on resource availability to predators may be spatially and temporally diverse and asynchronous. As capital breeders, whales are dependent on dense, predictable prey resources during foraging seasons. An Unusual Mortality Event (UME) of Eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whales (
              Eschrichtius robustus
              ) was declared in 2019 due to a dramatic rise in stranded animals, many emaciated. Climate change impacts may have affected prey availability on the primary foraging grounds of ENP gray whales ({\textasciitilde}20,000 individuals) in the Arctic and sub-Arctic region and in coastal habitats between northern California, USA and British Columbia, Canada where a small sub-group of ENP whales called the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG; {\textasciitilde}230 individuals) forages. To investigate variability of gray whale body condition relative to changing ocean conditions, we compare two datasets of gray whale aerial photogrammetry images collected
              via
              Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS) on the ENP wintering grounds in San Ignacio Lagoon, Mexico (SIL; n=111) and on the PCFG feeding grounds in Oregon, USA (n=72) over the same three-year period (2017–2019). We document concurrent body condition improvement of PCFG whales in Oregon while body condition of whales in SIL declined. This result indicates that the UME may have affected ENP whales due to reduced energetic gain on some Arctic/sub-Arctic foraging grounds, while PCFG whales are recovering from poor prey conditions during the NE Pacific marine heatwave event of 2014–2016. Surprisingly, we found that PCFG whales in Oregon had significantly worse body condition than whales in SIL, even when accounting for year and phenology. We derive support for this unexpected finding
              via
              photogrammetry analysis of opportunistic aerial images of gray whales on Arctic foraging grounds (n=18) compared to PCFG whales in Oregon (n=30): the body condition of PCFG whales was significantly lower (t=2.96, p=0.005), which may cause PCFG whales to have reduced reproductive capacity or resilience to environmental perturbations compared to ENP whales. Overall, our study elucidates divergent gray whale body condition across sub-groups and time, and we demonstrate the value of UAS to effectively monitor and identify the physiological response of whales to climate change.},

              Climate change is redistributing biodiversity globally and distributional shifts have been found to follow local climate velocities. It is largely assumed that marine endotherms such as cetaceans might shift more slowly than ectotherms in response to warming and would primarily follow changes in prey, but distributional shifts in cetaceans are difficult to quantify. Here we use data from fisheries bycatch and strandings to examine changes in the distribution of long-finned pilot whales (
              Globicephala melas
              ), and assess shifts in pilot whales and their prey relative to climate velocity in a rapidly warming region of the Northwest Atlantic. We found a poleward shift in pilot whale distribution that exceeded climate velocity and occurred at more than three times the rate of fish and invertebrate prey species. Fish and invertebrates shifted at rates equal to or slower than expected based on climate velocity, with more slowly shifting species moving to deeper waters. We suggest that traits such as mobility, diet specialization, and thermoregulatory strategy are central to understanding and anticipating range shifts. Our findings highlight the potential for trait-mediated climate shifts to decouple relationships between endothermic cetaceans and their ectothermic prey, which has important implications for marine food web dynamics and ecosystem stability.},

              Temperature-dependent sex determination, present in most turtle species, is a mechanism that uses temperature to direct the sex of the embryo. The rapid increase of global temperatures highlights the need for a clear assessment of how sex ratios of organisms with TSD are affected. In turtles with TSD, quantifying primary sex ratios is challenging because they lack external dimorphism and heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Here we describe a new technique used to identify sex in neonate turtles of two TSD species, a freshwater turtle (
              Trachemys scripta
              ) and a marine turtle (
              Caretta caretta
              ) via analysis of small blood samples. We used an immunoassay approach to test samples for the presence of several proteins known to play an important role in sex differentiation. Our results show that Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) can be reliably detected in blood samples from neonate male turtles but not females and can be used as a sex-specific marker. Verification of sex via histology or laparoscopy revealed that this method was 100\% reliable for identifying sex in both
              T. scripta
              and
              C. caretta
              1–2 day-old hatchlings and 90\% reliable for identifying sex in 83–177 day-old (120–160 g) loggerhead juveniles. The method described here is minimally invasive, and for the first time, greatly enhances our ability to measure neonate turtle sex ratios at population levels across nesting sites worldwide, a crucial step in assessing the impact of climate change on imperiled turtle species.},

Stable isotope analysis is a valuable complementary approach to conventional methods usually applied to the study of the foraging behavior of cetaceans because it provides dietary information over different time scales and can potentially use tissues archived in scientific collections. However, the considerable increase in stable isotope analysis by a growing number of cetacean research groups demands the use of proper protocols to ensure that accurate isotopic data are obtained. We provide a theoretical background of stable isotope analysis and its application to assess cetaceans‘ trophic ecology. We review the factors that can influence isotopic measurements and propose a practical guideline with suitable techniques for sample preparation of biological tissues to be employed by researchers to yield reliability in the interpretation of isotopic data. We summarized the main assumptions and inherent limitations that can lead to confounding interpretations of isotopic data, such as speciesand tissue-specific discrimination factors, temporal or spatial variation in prey, and baseline isotopic values in the context of cetacean ecology. Our detailed review offers important guidance for researchers who want to use stable isotope analysis to address different ecological questions with cetacean species.},

Collecting data on different taxa from the same platform is economically advantageous but normally comes at the cost of compromising optimal taxon-speciﬁc scanning patterns and survey parameters, in particular altitude. Here, we describe simultaneous visual and photographic sampling methods as a proof of concept for detecting large whales and turtles from a single aircraft, despite very different sighting cues. Data were collected for ﬁshing gear, ﬁsh, sharks, turtles, seals, dolphins, and whales using two observers and automated vertical photography. The photographic method documented an area directly beneath the aircraft that would otherwise have been obscured from observers. Preliminary density estimates were calculated for ﬁve species for which there were sufﬁcient sample sizes from both methods after an initial year of data collection. The photographic method yielded signiﬁcantly higher mean density estimates for loggerhead turtles, ocean sunﬁsh, and blue sharks (p {\textless} 0.01), despite sampling a substantially smaller area than visual scanning (less than 11\%). Density estimates from these two methods were not signiﬁcantly different for leatherback turtles or basking sharks (p {\textgreater} 0.05), two of the largest species included in the analysis, which are relatively easy to detect by both methods. Although postﬂight manual processing of photographic data was extensive, this sampling method comes at no additional in-ﬂight effort and obtains highquality digital documentation of sightings on the trackline. Future directions for this project include automating photographic sighting detections, expanding the area covered by photography, and performing morphometric measurement assessments.},

Sporadic nest counts at Jamursba Medi Beach at Bird’s Head have indicated a declining trend from the 1980s through 2004, although a relatively high amount of nesting has recently been documented at Wermon Beach, located 30 km east of Jamursba Medi. We used expanded year-round nesting surveys from 2005 to 2011 at these two primary nesting beaches to obtain more robust estimates of the nesting population size and to evaluate long-term nesting trends. We found a 29\% decline in nesting at Jamursba Medi and a 52\% decline at Wermon from 2005 through 2011. We found that the estimated annual number of nests at Jamursba Medi has declined 78.3\% over the past 27 years (5.5\% annual rate of decline) from 14,522 in 1984 to 1,596 in 2011. Nesting at Wermon has been monitored since 2002 and has declined 62.8\% (11.6\% annual rate of decline) from 2,994 nests in 2002 to 1,096 in 2011. Collectively, our findings indicate a continual and significant long term nesting decline of 5.9\% per year at these primary western Pacific beaches since 1984. Mark-recapture with PIT tags, initiated in 2003, resulted in the tagging of 1,371 individual nesting females as of March 2012. Observed clutch frequencies ranged from 3-10 per season with a mean of 5.5 6 1.6 and, based on nest counts, provide an estimate of approximately 489 females nesting in 2011. The persistent and long term decline we report for the Bird’s Head leatherback population follows other dramatic declines and extinctions of leatherback populations throughout the Pacific over the last 30 years. These findings highlight the urgent need for continued and enhanced conservation and management efforts to prevent the collapse of what might be the last remaining stronghold for leatherbacks in the Pacific.},

	abstract = {Bycatch, commonly referred to as entanglement, is a leading source of human-caused mortality of baleen whales. A better understanding of the individuals that survive (or perish from) their entanglement can help reduce the risk of bycatch by informing gear modifications and fisheries management. However, determining survival rates is restricted by the ability to track individuals once they become entangled. Historically, the effort to identify and resight individuals from known entanglement cases was low along the West Coast. The recent increase of entanglements and photo-identification efforts in the California, Oregon, and Washington region provides an opportunity to assess entangled humpback whales’ resighting rates to better understand the effect of entanglements from the individual to the population level. We used photo-ID images of entangled humpback whales between 1982 and 2017 to examine pre- and post-entanglement sighting histories from longitudinal catalogs and life history data (Cascadia Research and Happywhale). We compared the entangled whales (
              n
              = 37) against control whales (
              n
              = 2,296), selected based on the date and location of the entanglement reports, to evaluate the deviation from the expected mortality rates (or lack of resighting) caused by entanglements and to help inform/support/test National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s Serious Injury and Mortality (SI/M) index. Our results suggest that entangled whales were resighted less often than the control groups. Entangled whales with short pre-entanglement sighting histories and without post-entanglement resights did not match other feeding ground populations. Therefore, the higher proportion of entanglements with shorter sighting histories is likely due to their being alive for fewer years, indicating a higher risk of entanglement for younger whales. This indicates that entangled humpback whales may not be as large or strong as mature individuals, and future gear modifications should reflect that possibility. Additionally, the severity of the initial SI/M score aligned well with our resighting rates, though this worsened with the final score assigned. Continued effort to gather and improve data collection about entanglements will help enhance the SI/M determinations. Our findings show the value of photo-identification of entangled whales and how it dramatically increases our understanding of entanglements.},

	abstract = {Background: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables.
Results: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure.
Conclusion: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

	abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.
Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand.
Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

We ﬁt geostatistical delta-models to ﬁsheries observer bycatch data for six species with a broad range of movement patterns (e.g., highly migratory sea turtles versus sedentary rockﬁsh) and bycatch rates (percentage of observations with nonzero catch, 0.3\%–96.2\%). Random forests had better interpolation performance than the GMRF and GAM models for all six species, but random forests performance was more sensitive when predicting data at the edge of the ﬁshery (i.e., spatial extrapolation). Using random forests to identify and remove the 5\% highest bycatch risk ﬁshing events reduced the bycatch-to-target species catch ratio by 34\% on average. All models considerably reduced the bycatch-to-target ratio, demonstrating the clear potential of species distribution models to support spatial ﬁshery management.},

	abstract = {The eastern North Paciﬁc gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) population is considered “recovered” since the days of commercial whaling, with a population of over 25,000 animals. However, gray whale habitat is changing rapidly due to urbanization of the migratory coastal corridor, increases in shipping, and climate change altering water conditions and prey distribution. Increased single strandings and intermittent large-scale mortality events have occurred over the past 20 years, raising questions about how gray whale health is affected by whale population size (density dependence), climate change, and coastal development. To understand the impacts of these factors on health and the role of health changes in whale population dynamics, increased understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of diseases in gray whales is needed. To date, most information on gray whale health and disease is in single case reports, in sections of larger papers on whale ecology, or in technical memoranda and conference proceedings. Here we review existing data on gray whale health and disease to provide a synthesis of available information and a baseline for future studies, and suggest priorities for future study of gray whale health. The latter include nutritional studies to distinguish annual physiological fasting from starvation leading to mortality, identiﬁcation of endemic and novel viruses through increased use of molecular techniques, quantifying parasitic infections to explore interactions among prey shifts and parasite infection and body condition, as well as enhancing necropsy efforts to identify stochastic causes of mortality such as vessel strikes, entanglements, and predation. Integration of health and disease studies on individual animals with population monitoring and models of whale/prey dynamics will require interdisciplinary approaches to understand the role of health changes in population dynamics of this coastal whale.},

In the past decade, human-caused mortalities from vessel strikes and entanglements have been increasing, while birth rates in the population are at a 40 yr low. In addition to declining abundance, recent studies have shown that NARW length-at-age is decreasing due to the energetic impacts of sub-lethal entanglements, and that the body condition of the population is poorer than closely related southern right whales. We examined whether shorter body lengths are associated with reduced fecundity in female NARW. We compared age-corrected, modeled metrics of body length with 3 metrics of fecundity: age at first reproduction, average inter-birth interval, and the number of calves produced per potential reproductive year. We found that body length is significantly related to birth interval and calves produced per reproductive year, but not age at first reproduction. Larger whales had shorter inter-birth intervals and produced more calves per potential reproductive year. Larger whales also had higher lifetime calf production, but this was a result of larger whales having longer potential reproductive spans, as body lengths have generally been declining over the past 40 yr. Declining body sizes are a potential contributor to low birth rates over the past decade. Efforts to reduce entanglements and vessel strikes could help maintain population viability by increasing fecundity and improving resiliency of the population to other anthropogenic and climate impacts.},

While infrequent births and deaths may be important to the outlook of endangered populations, small sample sizes confound studies seeking the mechanisms underlying demographic ﬂuctuations. Individual metrics of health, such as nutritive condition, can provide a rich data source on population status and may translate into population trends. We examined interannual changes in body condition metrics of endangered Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW) collected using helicopters and remotely operated drones. We imaged and measured the condition of the majority of all three social pods (J, K, and L) in each of seven years between 2008 and 2019. We used Bayesian multi-state transition models to identify relationships between body condition changes and both tributary-speciﬁc and area-based indices of Chinook salmon abundance, and K-fold cross-validation to compare the predictive power of candidate salmon covariates. We found that Fraser River (tributary-speciﬁc) and Salish Sea (area-based) Chinook salmon abundances had the greatest predictive power for J Pod body condition changes, as well as the strongest relationships between any salmon covariates and SRKW condition across pods. Puget Sound (tributary-speciﬁc) Chinook salmon abundance had the greatest predictive power for L Pod body condition changes, but a weaker relationship than Fraser River or Salish Sea abundance had with J Pod body condition. The best-ﬁt model for K Pod included no Chinook covariates. In addition, we found elevated mortality probabilities in SRKW exhibiting poor body condition (reﬂecting depleted fat reserves), 2–3 times higher than whales in more robust condition. Collectively, these ﬁndings demonstrate that (1) ﬂuctuations in SRKW body condition can in some cases be linked to Chinook salmon abundance; (2) the three SRKW pods appear to have distinct patterns of body condition ﬂuctuations, suggesting different foraging patterns; and (3) aerial photogrammetry is a useful early-warning system that can identify SRKW at higher risk of mortality in the near future.},

	abstract = {Understanding population status for endangered species is critical to developing and evaluating recovery plans mandated by the Endangered Species Act. For sea turtles, changes in abundance are difﬁcult to detect because most life stages occur in the water. Currently, nest counts are the most reliable way of assessing trends. We determined the rate of growth for leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) nest numbers in Florida (USA) using a multilevel Poisson regression. We modeled nest counts from 68 beaches over 30 years and, using beach-level covariates (including latitude), we allowed for partial pooling of information between neighboring beaches. This modeling approach is ideal for nest count data because it recognizes the hierarchical structure of the data while incorporating variables related to survey effort. Nesting has increased at all 68 beaches in Florida, with trends ranging from 3.1\% to 16.3\% per year. Overall, across the state, the number of nests has been increasing by 10.2\% per year since 1979. Despite being a small population (probably ,1000 individuals), this nesting population may help achieve objectives in the federal recovery plan. This exponential growth rate mirrors trends observed for other Atlantic populations and may be driven partially by improved protection of nesting beaches. However, nesting is increasing even where beach protection has not been enhanced. Climate variability and associated marine food web dynamics, which could enhance productivity and reduce predators, may be driving this trend.},

	abstract = {Baleen whales store energy gained on foraging grounds to support reproduction and other metabolic needs while fasting for long periods during migration. Whale body condition can be used to monitor foraging success, and thus better understand and anticipate individual- and population-level trends in reproduction and survival. We assessed the body condition of eastern North Paciﬁc gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) on their foraging grounds along the Oregon coast, USA, from June to October of three consecutive years (2016–2018). We used drone photogrammetry and applied the body area index (BAI) to measure and compare whale body condition, which is a continuous, unitless metric similar to the body mass index in humans. A total of 289 drone ﬂights were carried out over 106 photo-identiﬁed whales, which were grouped into demographic units by sex, maturity, and female reproductive status. Calves and pregnant females displayed the highest BAIs, followed by resting females, mature males, and, ﬁnally, lactating females, reﬂecting the signiﬁcant energetic demands on reproductive females. In all three years, gray whale body condition improved with the progression of feeding seasons, demonstrating the accumulation of body energy reserves on the foraging grounds. Yet, body condition was signiﬁcantly better in 2016 than in 2017 and 2018 when overall body depletion was observed, indicating a difference in prey availability and/or quality between years. We analyzed local upwelling patterns between 2013 and 2018 as an oceanographic proxy for prey and determined signiﬁcantly greater upwelling between 2013 and 2015 than low upwelling years between 2016 and 2018. We hypothesize that these upwelling patterns created ecosystem shifts in primary productivity and zooplankton prey of gray whales, causing carry-over effects between foraging success and body condition in subsequent years. This study demonstrates the value of monitoring whale body condition to better understand temporal variation in foraging success, and potentially detect and describe the causes of anomalous changes in whale population health, such as the 2019 gray whale mortality event.},

	abstract = {Under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act, common bottlenose dolphins along the United States Atlantic coast are managed as a series of 17 distinct stocks. To determine the status of each stock, the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) is compared with anthropogenic removals, primarily as a result of fisheries bycatch. Estimates of abundance, with associated measures of variance, are required to generate the PBR for each stock. The objectives of the current study were to estimate abundance for the Southern North Carolina Estuarine System Stock (SNCESS) of common bottlenose dolphins and to better define the southern boundary of this stock. To meet these objectives, photo-identification surveys were conducted during the summer and winter of 2014 in estuarine and nearshore coastal waters in southern North Carolina. The surveys extended 25km South of the defined southern stock boundary, along the northern South Carolina coast. One mark and one recapture survey were conducted for each season. Each survey was completed in four or five days and covered over 300km of survey tracklines. Dorsal fin images were processed and managed using FinBase, and only images of suitable quality and distinctiveness were used for estimates of abundance. A three-step decision tree was used to assign each dolphin group to either the SNCESS or an adjacent coastal stock, based on sighting location, ranging patterns derived from matches to photoidentification catalogues and statistical modelling. Only sightings classified as SNCESS were used to estimate stock abundance. Abundance estimates were calculated using three approaches: the Chapman modification to the Lincoln-Petersen method, package Rcapture in program R and program MARK 6.2. The most parsimonious approach was the Chapman LP method yielding an estimate of 272 dolphins (95\% CI 189–390, CV = 0.32) in the summer of 2014. The distribution of SNCESS dolphins shifted South in the winter and several individuals were observed up to 70km southwest of the currently recognised southern boundary. The results of this study support the current definition of the SNCESS but suggest revisions to the southern boundary. The SNCESS is the smallest bottlenose dolphin stock off the East coast of the USA and is at risk of population decline as a result of fisheries-related mortality.},

	abstract = {Major aggregations of nesting green turtles (Chelonia mydas) occur in the northern Red Sea, although little is known about the reproductive ecology of this endangered species in the region. To address this issue, we satellite-tracked 30 female green turtles to document their movements and to identify factors driving habitat use at two major rookeries in the Red Sea, Jazirat Mashabah (Mashabah Island) and Ras Al Baridi in Saudi Arabia. Between successive nesting events, turtles displayed high ﬁdelity to nesting beaches and adjacent in-water habitats (inter-nesting habitats). Using generalized linear mixed models, we estimated the mean probability of nesting per beach emergence (nesting success rate) to be 0.628, and the mean duration between a successful nesting event and the successive emergence onto the beach (re-nesting interval) to be 10.8 days at each site. The nesting success rate was relatively high ({\textgreater}0.8) when the preceding daytime land surface temperature (LST) was lower than 37◦C but decreased with elevated daytime LST ({\textless}0.4 when {\textgreater}47◦C). Re-nesting interval was longer at lower water temperatures and towards the end of the nesting season of individuals. Our study improves the robustness of abundance estimates from census data (e.g., track counts) and shows that the protection of nesting and internesting habitats during a breeding season would be an effective conservation strategy for the species. We discuss how global warming could increase energy expenditure due to lowered nesting success, ultimately compromising the reproductive ﬁtness of these populations.},

              Blubber and serum testosterone levels were compared among 55 individual common bottlenose dolphins,
              Tursiops truncatus
              , in Sarasota Bay, FL during 2011–2019. A significant positive relationship between the matrices was found in male testosterone concentrations in 29 paired samples (r
              2
               = 0.932). Mature males (n = 17) had 300 times greater mean testosterone concentration in serum than immature males (n = 17). A comparison of blubber samples, including 12 females, 24 immature males, and 19 mature males, revealed significant differences in mean blubber testosterone values among all three demographics. Immature males had greater than 6 times the average blubber testosterone concentration of females and mature males had almost 100 times that of immature males. Estimated testis volume was highly correlated with blubber testosterone concentration and mature males had 60 times greater average testis volume than immature males. We observed seasonal variation in blubber testosterone in mature males, consistent with known reproductive patterns. These data suggest males can be distinguished from females and designated as mature or immature via blubber testosterone concentrations, an observation that validates dart biopsy sampling as a means of obtaining demographic data.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) nesting is crucial for management of this species. Limited data exist on the nesting patterns of green turtles along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) coast. From 1987 to 2019, 211 green turtle nesting activities were documented on the Texas coast, including 111 conﬁrmed nests and 100 non-nesting emergences. Of the 111 nests, 99 were located on North Padre Island (97 at Padre Island National Seashore (PAIS), two north of PAIS) and 12 on South Padre Island (six within the Laguna Atascosa or Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), six outside of a NWR). Of the 100 non-nesting emergences, 75 were on North Padre Island (70 at PAIS, 5 north of PAIS), 21 on South Padre Island (nine within a NWR, 12 outside of a NWR), one on Boca Chica Beach, two on San Jose Island, and one on Mustang Island. Nearly all of the nests (92.8\%) and most of the non-nesting emergences (79.0\%) were on property protected by the United States Department of the Interior as PAIS or a NWR, and conﬁrmed nest density was largest at PAIS, highlighting the importance of these federally protected lands as nesting habitat for this threatened species. Of the 111 located nests, eight were predated. Mean hatching success of the 103 non-predated nests was 77.4\%, and 9,475 hatchlings were released from the predated and non-predated nests. The largest annual number of green turtle nests documented was 29 in 2017. Nesting appeared to increase since 2010, but at a much lower rate than at other GoM nesting beaches. To aid with recovery, efforts should be undertaken to monitor long-term nesting trends, protect nesting turtles and nests, and investigate potential causes for the slower recovery in Texas. Additionally, the genetic structure of the population that nests in Texas should be determined to reveal if the population warrants recognition as a unique management unit, or if it is part of a broader unit that is a shared nesting resource with Mexico which is already being considered as a unique management unit.},

Marine mammals are sentinels of persistent and bioaccumulative contaminants due to their longevity and high trophic position. Using nontargeted analysis, we constructed a mass spectral library of 327 persistent and bioaccumulative compounds identiﬁed in blubber from two ecotypes of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled in the Southern California Bight. This library of halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) consisted of 180 anthropogenic contaminants, 41 natural products, 4 with mixed sources, 8 with unknown sources, and 94 with partial structural characterization and unknown sources. The abundance of compounds whose structures could not be fully elucidated highlights the prevalence of undiscovered HOCs accumulating in marine food webs. Eighty-six percent of the identiﬁed compounds are not currently monitored, including 133 known anthropogenic chemicals. Compounds related to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were the most abundant. Natural products were, in some cases, detected at abundances similar to anthropogenic compounds. The proﬁle of naturally occurring HOCs diﬀered between ecotypes, suggesting more abundant oﬀshore sources of these compounds. This nontargeted analytical framework provided a comprehensive list of HOCs that may be characteristic of the region, and its application within monitoring surveys may suggest new chemicals for evaluation.},

	abstract = {The Pacific Coast of the Baja California Peninsula (BCP), Mexico, is a hotspot for foraging loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta originating from nesting beaches in Japan. The BCP region is also known for anthropogenic sea turtle mortality that numbers thousands of turtles annually. To put the conservation implications of this mortality into biological context, we conducted aerial surveys to determine the distribution and abundance of loggerhead turtles in the Gulf of Ulloa, along the BCP Pacific Coast. Each year from 2005 to 2007, we surveyed ca. 3700 km of transect lines, including areas up to 140 km offshore. During these surveys, we detected loggerhead turtles at the water’s surface on 755 occasions (total of 785 loggerheads in groups of up to 7 turtles). We applied standard line-transect methods to estimate sea turtle abundance for survey data collected during good to excellent sighting conditions, which included 447 loggerhead sightings during {\textasciitilde}6400 km of survey effort. We derived the proportion of time that loggerheads were at the surface and visible to surveyors based on in situ dive data. The mean annual abundance of 43 226 loggerhead turtles (CV = 0.51, 95\% CI range = 15 017 to 100 444) represents the first abundance estimate for foraging North Pacific loggerheads based on robust analytical approaches. Our density estimate confirms the importance of the BCP as a major foraging area for loggerhead turtles in the North Pacific. In the context of annual mortality estimates of loggerheads near BCP, these results suggest that up to 11\% of the region’s loggerhead population may perish each year due to anthropogenic and/or natural threats. We calculate that up to 50\% of the loggerhead turtles residing in the BCP region in any given year will die within 15 yr if current mortality rates continue. This underscores the urgent need to minimize anthropogenic and natural mortality of local loggerheads.},

Tag deployment durations ranged from 63 to 247 days and turtles exhibited three distinct behavior types: foraging, transiting, or rapidly switching between foraging and transiting. Some females were tracked to nesting beaches in the Caribbean. Most of the leatherbacks remained on and foraged along the west Florida continental shelf whereas a few individuals foraged in waters of the central Gulf of Mexico during the autumn and winter. In addition, migration of adult females through the Yucatan Channel indicate that this is a seasonally important area for Caribbean nesting assemblages.},

Stranding events were related to the accumulation of consecutive days with lower sea surface temperature (SST) series for the corresponding periods using Pearson correlations. Our results showed that in both periods, a significant crosscorrelation was observed between mass stranding and accumulation of consecutive days with temperatures below 18, 17, and 16°C, with a time lag of three to five months. Numerical evidence supports the hypothesis that although the loggerhead turtle mortality is caused by multiple factors under extreme cold events, the environment turns markedly unfavorable for these organisms. Side-effects on health and swimming behavior of the species C. caretta, compromise their ability to avoid obstacles or flee from predators, thus increasing their vulnerability to sickness or lethargy, and possibly leading to the massive stranding of weakened individuals or dead bodies to the beaches of the Gulf of Ulloa. Hence, while SST may not be the direct cause of turtle mortality, it can be a determining factor for the survival of this species.},

The unique microbial communities recovered from these dolphins suggest a greater microbial diversity on the skin of offshore ecotype bottlenose dolphins, while microbial populations associated with the coastal ecotype include species that are more closely related to each other and that suggest exposure to communities that are likely to be associated with terrestrial runoff.},

	title = {Timing of the gray whale southbound migration},
	abstract = {The southbound migration of the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) has been documented by the National Marine Fisheries Service most seasons since 1967 at or near Granite Canyon, in central California, and by the American Cetacean Society’s Los Angeles Chapter every season since 1985 at Point Vicente, southern California. This has provided a rare opportunity to examine cetacean migratory timing data over a relatively long time series. In 1998/99, anecdotal reports indicated a major change had occurred in the timing of the migration, which prompted this study to compare the observed timing relative to expected dates. Although no observers were at Granite Canyon in 1998/99, data collected from this site indicated that prior to 1980, annual median sighting dates ranged from 4-13 January (overall median = 8 January; CI = 1.3), but since then there has been a one-week (6.8 day; CI = 2.0) delay, with median dates now ranging from 12-18 January (overall median = 15 January; CI = 1.7). This delay in timing is better represented as a shift in dates than as a trend, and it occurred shortly after a major oceanographic regime shift in the North Pacific Ocean. The shift in whale sighting dates occurred equally in the onset of the migrations (when the first 10\% of the whales passed a site), the median (50\%) and end (when 90\% of the whales passed). At Granite Canyon, there were no significant trends in these dates prior to 1980 or in dates following the shift. In mid-February (median = 15 February, CI = 1.9, at Point Vicente), few gray whales are still going south and some are already migrating north. Most of the migration (the period between the 10\% and 90\% sighting dates) occurs across a period of 34 days (CI = 2.0), but the entire southbound migration may take {\textgreater} 70 days to pass a location in any given year. It takes a whale approximately 54 days to migrate from the north central Bering Sea to the lagoons in Baja California (8,000km), but some whales may travel as far as 10,000km. Based on available observations and calculations using a travel rate of 147km/day, current median (peak) sighting dates of the southbound migration should be: 1 December in the north central Bering Sea (here considered the theoretical starting point for the migration); 12 December at Unimak Pass, Alaska; 18 December for Kodiak Island, Alaska; 5 January for Washington State; 7 January for Oregon; 15 January for central California; 18 January in southern California; and 24 January at the northern lagoons in Baja California (considered here to be the terminus of the migration). Although no observations were made at Granite Canyon in 1998/99, sightings made at Yaquina Head, Oregon (median sighting date = 7 January) and at Point Vicente (median = 20 January) indicate that the timing of that migration was consistent with previous years.},

Newly developed spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models address these limitations by speciﬁcation of explicit models for spatial sampling as well as the spatial distribution of individuals in the population. Spatial capture–recapture models have not yet been applied to the study of chelonian populations.

Recently, a new, evolutionarily divergent lineage of Bryde's-like whale was identified based on genetic data and was found to be restricted primarily to the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOMx). Here, we provide the first morphological examination of a complete skull from these whales and identify diagnostic characters that distinguish it from the other medium-sized baleen whale taxa. In addition, we have increased the number of genetic samples of these Bryde's-like whales in the GOMx from 23 to 36 individuals, all of which matched the GOMx lineage. A review of Bryde's-like whale records in the Caribbean and greater Atlantic supports an isolated distribution for this unique lineage, augmenting the genetic and morphological body of evidence supporting the existence of an undescribed species of Balaenoptera from the Gulf of Mexico.},

Although Green Sea Turtles (Chelonia mydas), Leatherback Sea Turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), Hawksbill Sea Turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), and Olive Ridley Sea Turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) have been extensively studied in Costa Rica, little information regarding Loggerhead Sea Turtles (Caretta caretta) is available.

We collected Loggerhead nesting data between 1957 and 2021 through daytime and nocturnal monitoring activities. We documented 14 Loggerhead Sea Turtle nesting attempts between 1957 and 2021 at Tortuguero. Among them, seven nested successfully, four did not lay eggs, and one’s fate is unknown. Additionally, two turtles were killed by jaguars. Mean minimum curve carapace length (CCLmin) measurements for Loggerheads was 98.2 6 3.7 cm (range, 90.0–101.4 cm). Finally, we found that every encounter occurred between April and July, which coincides with the Loggerhead nesting season in the Northwest Atlantic. Our study is the ﬁrst assessment of Loggerhead Sea Turtles nesting in Costa Rica, bringing to light new records for this species in the Caribbean Sea.},

In the Sainte Marie channel, Madagascar, straightforward aerial single-camera photogrammetry was tested on mother-calf pairs that combines standard Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with free, easy-to-access, and user-friendly software. The goals of the study were to estimate mother and calf body measurements and to investigate the effect of maternal parity (primiparous versus multiparous, based on length) on calf size. A mean length of 12.4±1.2 m for mothers (N = 16) and 5±0.9 m for calves (N = 16) was estimated. The size of calves did not depend significantly on maternal parity. The photogrammetry method used was simple and cost-effective, yet produced convincing morphometric measurements with acceptable precision and accuracy. The coefficients of variation (CVs) of repeated estimates and the level of error were relatively low (CV = 2.31 \% for a known-sized object and average CV = 2.52 \% for individual whales; average error = 1.8 \% for a known-sized object). These results will encourage more teams to study the morphometry of large marine mammals despite limitations in terms of resources.},

We determined the relative importance of eight environmental variables (bathymetry, distance to shore, slope, chlorophyll-a, salinity, eastwards sea water velocity, northwards sea water velocity and sea surface temperature) as drivers of seasonal habitat preferences of Bryde’s whales (
              Balaenoptera brydei

              ). Using presence only data from multiple sources, we constructed predictive species distribution models (SDMs) consisting of ensembles of seven algorithms for these species during both summer and winter. Predicted distribution for all cetaceans was high in southern Africa and, in particular, within the South African Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Predictive models indicated a more pronounced seasonal variation for humpback, sperm and southern right whales than for Bryde’s whales. Southern right whales occurred closer to shore during winter, humpback whales were more likely to occur along the east coast in winter and the west coast in summer, and sperm whales were more concentrated off the shelf in winter. Our study shows that ensemble models using historical, incidental and scientific data, in conjunction with modern environmental variables, can provide baseline knowledge on important environmental drivers of cetacean distribution for conservation purposes. Results of this study can further be used to help develop marine spatial plans and identify important marine mammal areas.},

This study investigates the consequences of the quality of monitoring on PBR performance. It also explores stochastic and demographic uncertainty, catastrophic events, sublethal effects of interactions with ﬁshing gear, and the situation of a marine mammal population subject to bycatch in two ﬁsheries, only one of which is managed. Results are presented for two pinniped and two cetacean life histories. Bias in abundance estimates and whether there is a linear relationship between abundance estimates and true abundance most inﬂuence conservation performance. Catastrophic events and trends in natural mortality have larger effects than environmental stochasticity. Managing only one of two ﬁsheries with signiﬁcant bycatch leads, as expected, to a lower probability of achieving conservation management goals, and better outcomes would be achieved if bycatch in all ﬁsheries were managed. The results are qualitatively the same for the four life histories, but estimates of the probability of population recovery differ.},

We used aerial photogrammetry to determine total length (TL) of 221 individual Type C killer whales—a ﬁsh-eating ecotype that inhabits dense pack ice—in the southern Ross Sea in January 2005. We conﬁrmed it as one of the smallest killer whales known: TL of adult females (with calves) averaged 5.2 m 6 0.23 SD (n ¼ 33); adult males averaged 5.6 6 0.32 m (n ¼ 65), with the largest measuring 6.1 m. Female Type A killer whales—offshore mammal-eaters—from Soviet whaling data in the Southern Ocean were approximately 1–2 m longer, and males were 2–3 m (up to 50\%) longer (maximum length 9.2 m). Killer whale communities from the North Atlantic and in waters around Japan also appear to support both a smaller, inshore, ﬁsh-eating form and a larger, offshore, mammal-eating form. We suggest that, at least in Antarctica, this degree of size dimorphism could result in reproductive isolation between sympatric ecotypes, which is consistent with hypotheses of multiple species of killer whales in the Southern Ocean.},

Here we present a method for surveying population health that uses UAVs to sample respiratory vapor, ‘whale blow,’ exhaled by free-swimming humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and coupled this with ampliﬁcation and sequencing of respiratory tract microbiota. We developed a low-cost multirotor UAV incorporating a sterile petri dish with a remotely operated ‘blow’ to sample whale blow with minimal disturbance to the whales. This design addressed several sampling challenges: accessibility; safety; cost, and critically, minimized the collection of atmospheric and seawater microbiota and other potential sources of sample contamination. We collected 59 samples of blow from northward migrating humpback whales off Sydney, Australia and used high throughput sequencing of bacterial ribosomal gene markers to identify putative respiratory tract microbiota. Model-based comparisons with seawater and dronecaptured air demonstrated that our system minimized external sources of contamination and successfully captured sufﬁcient material to identify whale blow-speciﬁc microbial taxa. Whale-speciﬁc taxa included species and genera previously associated with the respiratory tracts or oral cavities of mammals (e.g., Pseudomonas, Clostridia, Cardiobacterium), as well as species previously isolated from dolphin or killer whale blowholes (Corynebacteria, others). Many examples of exogenous marine species were identiﬁed, including Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. that have been associated with the skin microbiota of marine mammals and ﬁsh and may include pathogens. This information provides a baseline of respiratory tract microbiota proﬁles of contemporary whale health. Customized UAVs are a promising new tool for marine megafauna research and may have broad application in cost-effective monitoring and management of whale populations worldwide.},

	abstract = {Human activities that impact wildlife do not necessarily remove individuals from populations. They may also change individual behaviour in ways that have sublethal effects. This has driven interest in developing analytical tools that predict the population consequences of short-term behavioural responses. In this study, we incorporate empirical information on the ecology of a population of bottlenose dolphins into an individual-based model that predicts how individuals' behavioural dynamics arise from their underlying motivational states, as well as their interaction with boat traffic and dredging activities. We simulate the potential effects of proposed coastal developments on this population and predict that the operational phase may affect animals' motivational states. For such results to be relevant for management, the effects on individuals' vital rates also need to be quantified. We investigate whether the relationship between an individual's exposure and the survival of its calves can be directly estimated using a Bayesian multi-stage model for calf survival. The results suggest that any effect on calf survival is probably small and that a significant relationship could only be detected in large, closely studied populations. Our work can be used to guide management decisions, accelerate the consenting process for coastal and offshore developments and design targeted monitoring.},

Little is known of the connectivity between these sites in the Arabian region for green sea turtles. We document linkages between two foraging areas in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with key nesting sites and provide insights on effectiveness of marine protected areas for green sea turtles. Tracking 45 adult green sea turtles Chelonia mydas from foraging areas in the UAE, we show that the primary nesting destination for turtles foraging in Bu Tinah in the UAE is Ras al Hadd in Oman. The turtles use the waters of the UAE, Iran and Oman during breeding migrations and generally stay {\textasciitilde} 20 km off the coast, in waters 10–20 m deep except when crossing the Sea of Oman. Turtles display substantial fidelity to the original foraging sites, often traversing other known foraging sites when returning from the breeding migration. A small proportion of turtles also utilise more than one foraging site. Our data indicate that the Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi is broadly coincident with the foraging areas of turtles offering substantial protection from fishery activities and that the marine protected area in Ras Al Khaimah would be more effective in protecting green sea turtles if it extended offshore and along the coast. These data may contribute to targeted and effective national and international management and conservation initiatives in the Arabian region.},

	abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efﬁcacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in ﬁeld guides. All models were signiﬁcantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

The results show how interannual variation in sea ice cover in the Bering and Chukchi Seas along with broader indices of North Pacific climate, such as Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Index (NPI), are linked to variation in gray whale reproductive output. Estimates of gray whale calf production were derived from 23 consecutive years (1994–2016) of shore-based visual surveys conducted off California during the northward migration. PDO and NPI in combination with ice cover in the Bering and Chukchi Seas during the early phase of gestation appear to be important in explaining the observed variability in calf production. Of the 2,285 time series linear models evaluated, the model of best-fit included PDO(July), Ice(June), NPI(February), and explained 60\% of the observed variability in calf production. After elimination of two data outliers in calf production estimates (2013 and 2014) a model including Ice(May), PDO(May), and NPI(July) explained 90\% of the variability. We conclude that access to prey early in the gestation period is critical to reproductive success in this population and may be important for other capital breeding mammals.},

	abstract = {Marine turtles encounter different threats during various life-history stages. Therefore, understanding their movements and spatial distribution is crucial for effectively managing these long-lived migratory organisms. This study combines satellite telemetry data with long-term capture-mark-recapture data derived from flipper tag studies to determine distribution patterns of endangered loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) during post-nesting migrations from different eastern Australian nesting sites. Individuals from the K’gari-Fraser Island and Great Barrier Reef island rookeries typically migrated northward, whereas individuals from mainland rookeries migrated equally northward and southward. Despite this difference in foraging distribution, loggerheads from the different rookeries did not differ substantially in their migration duration or distance travelled. The foraging distribution identified from successful satellite tag deployments represented 50\% of the foraging distribution identified from a large long-term flipper tag recovery database. However, these satellite telemetry results have identified new migration and foraging habitats not previously recognised for loggerhead turtles nesting in eastern Australia. Additionally, they support the conclusion from a past study using flipper tag recovery data that the mainland nesting turtles migrate to different foraging grounds than the turtles nesting on Great Barrier Reef islands. Collectively, the two data sources provide valuable data on the migration route, habitat distribution and ecological range for a threatened genetic stock of loggerhead turtles.},

The overlap of intense bottom-set net ﬁsheries with a highdensity foraging hot spot of endangered loggerhead turtles at Baja California Sur, Mexico (BCS) produces among the highest recorded megafauna bycatch rates worldwide. From 2007 to 2009, we conducted controlled experiments in partnership with local ﬁshermen at BCS to compare turtle bycatch rates with target catch rates, composition, and market value between conventional (control) and buoyless (buoys removed from ﬂoat line) nets. In 136 controlled sets of net pairs, buoyless nets reduced mean turtle bycatch rates by 68\% while maintaining target catch rates and composition. Our results suggest that buoyless nets offer a promising approach for mitigating sea turtle and potentially other megafauna bycatch while maintaining coastal net ﬁsheries worldwide.},

Forty juveniles satellite-tracked from neritic habitat revealed utilization distributions 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those of 26 juveniles of the same size class tracked for similar durations from oceanic habitat. Oceanic juveniles traveled significantly further, faster and straighter, experienced lower sea surface temperature and productivity, and consumed prey of much lower energy density, strongly suggesting that the neritic foraging strategy is energetically favorable. These findings combined with those from other studies suggest that the neritic strategy would result in higher growth and eventually higher fecundity. Manipulation of a loggerhead demographic model indicated that small disadvantages in survivorship for neritic juveniles could balance the relatively large advantages in growth and fecundity of the neritic strategy. The oceanic strategy may persist as a slower but safer life history strategy. Our findings underscore the importance of elucidating variation in the ecology and corresponding vital rates of juveniles for modeling, managing, and conserving migratory megafaunal populations.},

	abstract = {Assessing mortality of long-lived organisms is fundamental for understanding population trends and for implementing conservation strategies, but doing so for marine megafauna is challenging. Here we assessed anthropogenic mortality of endangered North Pacific loggerhead turtles in the coastal waters of Baja California Sur, Mexico (BCS), through the synthesis of 3 sources: (1) intensive surveys of an index shoreline from 2003 to 2007; (2) bimonthly surveys of additional shorelines and towns for stranded and consumed carcasses from 2006 to 2007; and (3) observations of bycatch by 2 small-scale fishing fleets. Using Monte Carlo simulations we estimate that 1500 to 2950 loggerhead turtles died per year at BCS from 2005 to 2006 due to bycatch in the 2 observed fleets. Actual mortality may be considerably higher due to bycatch in other fisheries, directed hunting for black market trade, and natural factors including predation and disease. From 2003 to 2007 we encountered 2719 loggerhead carcasses on shorelines and in and around towns of BCS. Along the 43 km Playa San Lázaro, 0.25 loggerheads km–1 d–1 were stranded during summer fishing months over 5 yr, which is among the highest reported stranding rates worldwide. This stranding rate corroborates similarly high observed bycatch rates for local small-scale longline (29 loggerheads 1000 hooks–1) and gillnet (1.0 loggerhead km–1 of net) fisheries. A significant increase in mean length of 2636 carcasses measured at BCS occurred from 1995 to 2007. Given the endangered status of the North Pacific loggerhead population, conservation action to reduce bycatch and poaching at BCS is urgently needed.},

              It is well established that sea turtles are vulnerable to atmospheric and oceanographic shifts associated with climate change. However, few studies have formally projected how their seasonal marine habitat may shift in response to warming ocean temperatures. Here we used a high-resolution global climate model and a large satellite tagging dataset to project changes in the future distribution of suitable thermal habitat for loggerheads along the northeastern continental shelf of the United States. Between 2009 and 2018, we deployed 196 satellite tags on loggerheads within the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) of the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf region, a seasonal foraging area. Tag location data combined with depth and remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) were used to characterize the species’ current thermal range in the MAB. The best-fitting model indicated that the habitat envelope for tagged loggerheads consisted of SST ranging from 11.0° to 29.7 °C and depths between 0 and 105.0 m. The calculated core bathythermal range consisted of SSTs between 15.0° and 28.0 °C and depths between 8.0 and 92.0 m, with the highest probability of presence occurred in regions with SST between 17.7° and 25.3 °C and at depths between 26.1 and 74.2 m. This model was then forced by a high-resolution global climate model under a doubling of atmospheric CO
              2
              to project loggerhead probability of presence over the next 80 years. Our results suggest that loggerhead thermal habitat and seasonal duration will likely increase in northern regions of the NW Atlantic shelf. This change in spatiotemporal range for sea turtles in a region of high anthropogenic use may prompt adjustments to the localized protected species conservation measures.},

Even when survey effort dedicated to a population is extensive, many deaths may go unseen. We used an abundance estimation model to derive estimates of cryptic mortality for North Atlantic right whales and found that observed carcasses accounted for only 36\% of all estimated death during 1990–2017. We found strong evidence that total mortality varied over time, and that observed carcass counts were poor predictors of estimated annual numbers of whales dying. Importantly, there were substantial differences between fractions of deaths determined to be entanglement related during necropsy (49\%) and the fraction of cryptic deaths suffering serious injuries related to entanglement (87\%). Although we concluded that a single year's observations produced poor estimates of carcass detection rates due to the volatility of ratios of small counts, ratio estimates of data pooled over periods of consistent survey may offer better information on detection rates. Additionally, it appears unwise to consider cause of death determinations from detected carcasses as representative of cause-specific mortality rates in right whales given the large number of seriously injured whales from entanglement that are likely part of the unseen mortality.},

	abstract = {Harbor porpoises exhibit early maturation, relatively short gestation/lactation periods and a faster rate of reproduction as compared to other cetacean species. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors can influence both population vital rates and population structure, which ultimately cause changes in dynamics within and between populations. Here, we undertook a retrospective analysis of mortality data collected over a 24-year period for assessing life history traits of the North-east Atlantic harbor porpoise population. We use time-period specific models for key life history relationships that considered cause of death of individuals (as a proxy for health status), sex and management unit (MU). Sexual variation in asymptotic length, asymptotic age, average length at 50\% maturity (L50) and average age at 50\% maturity (A50) were observed, with females attaining a larger asymptotic length, larger L50, and delaying attainment of both sexual and physical maturity, compared to males. While females are constrained in their minimum body size due to giving birth to proportionally larger offspring, males exhibited more plasticity in size at sexual maturity, enabling re-allocation of available energy resources toward reproduction. Data were then used to compare biological parameters among two porpoise MUs in United Kingdom waters, both of which in the current study exhibited reduced reproductive rates compared to other geographic regions. In both MUs, females significantly increased their A50 and males significantly declined in their L50. An increase in the age at asymptotic length was also observed in both sexes, along with a significant decline in the Gompertz growth rate parameter that was more apparent in the female data. While availability of suitable prey resources may be a limiting factor, a combination of other factors cannot be ruled out. Porpoises in the Celtic and Irish Seas MU were significantly larger in their maximum length, asymptotic length and L50 compared to porpoises in the North Sea MU throughout the study period, suggesting limited gene flow between these two MUs. These results justify the maintenance of these harbor porpoise MUs or assessment units, as two separate units, within the range of the North-east Atlantic population, and for indicator assessments under the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

Based on {\textgreater} 4500 individual measurements over 21 years (1996–2016), we found the curved carapace length of nesting females declined by about 0.64 cm per decade, from 111.43 to 110.08 cm. For 391 individuals that were measured more than once with measurement interval of 2.8–19 years apart, the mean growth rate was 0.14 cm ­year−1. Comparisons between the size of adult females and males were based on 23 and 14 weight measurements, 107 and 33 carapace length measurements and 103 and 33 carapace width measurements, respectively, taken during 1981–1983. Adult females were larger than males, with the sexual dimorphism index, i.e. the ratio of size of the larger sex to the smaller, being 1.09 and 1.10 for carapace length and width, respectively, and 1.25 for weight. Smaller females tended to lay fewer eggs per clutch but the decrease in female mean size was accompanied by increases in numbers of turtles nesting annually, such that the estimated total numbers of eggs per year increased from 1.3 million to 2.0 million between 1996 and 2016. Therefore, a decrease in mean size of nesting females has not compromised egg production for this population.},

            The current known distribution of Omura’s whale includes the tropical and warm temperate waters of the western Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. Evidence of their presence in the Atlantic Ocean is based on beach cast specimens found on the coasts of Mauritania (North Atlantic) and Northeastern Brazil (South Atlantic). The present study characterizes the occurrence of this species in the São Pedro and São Paulo Archipelago (SPSPA), on the mid-Atlantic ridge between South America and Africa, based on autonomous recording systems. Acoustic signals were similar, but not identical, to B. omurai vocalizations recorded off the coast of Madagascar. Although these signals were recorded for only 11 months, there are peaks in vocal activity between May and June in the vicinities of SPSPA, suggesting either a shift in distribution within the Atlantic equatorial waters or seasonality in the species’ vocal behavior in this region. The first acoustic records of Omura’s whales in the Equatorial Atlantic suggest that these animals may also use deep-water habitats, in addition to the shallow-water habitat use observed in other regions.},

              , and patterns of wind-driven biophysical forcing in the northern Bering and eastern Chukchi seas. This portion of the Pacific Arctic includes four Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) sampling regions. In the Bering Strait area, passive acoustic data showed marked declines in gray whale calling activity coincident with unprecedented wintertime sea ice loss there in 2017–2019, although some whales were seen there during DBO cruises in those years. In the northern Bering Sea, sightings during DBO cruises show changes in gray whale distribution coincident with a shrinking field of infaunal amphipods, with a significant decrease in prey abundance (r = -0.314, p{\textless}0.05) observed in the DBO 2 region over the 2010–2019 period. In the eastern Chukchi Sea, sightings during broad scale aerial surveys show that gray whale distribution is associated with localized areas of high infaunal crustacean abundance. Although infaunal crustacean prey abundance was unchanged in DBO regions 3, 4 and 5, a mid-decade shift in gray whale distribution corresponded to both: (i) a localized increase in infaunal prey abundance in DBO regions 4 and 5, and (ii) a correlation of whale relative abundance with wind patterns that can influence epi-benthic and pelagic prey availability. Specifically, in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, increased sighting rates (whales/km) associated with an {\textasciitilde}110 km (60 nm) offshore shift in distribution was positively correlated with large scale and local wind patterns conducive to increased availability of krill. In the southern Chukchi Sea, gray whale distribution clustered in all years near an amphipod-krill ‘hotspot’ associated with a 50-60m deep trough. We discuss potential impacts of observed and inferred prey shifts on gray whale nutrition in the context of an ongoing unusual gray whale mortality event. To conclude, we use the conceptual Arctic Marine Pulses (AMP) model to frame hypotheses that may guide future research on whales in the Pacific Arctic marine ecosystem.},

Studies addressing the adaptive significance TSD have been hampered by the difficulty of accurately estimating sex ratios under natural incubation conditions. Here we introduce the thermal reaction norm for sexualization, a novel concept measuring the strength of masculinization or feminization of temperatures, to model the effect of temperature for sex determination in TSD species. We use hatchling sex ratio data and field incubation temperatures collected between 2002 and 2018 at a globally important loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting rookery. The new parametrization makes possible the understanding of how temperature-sensitive sex determination works. We show that the temperature could influence the sexualization of the gonad earlier than what is currently recog­ nized. Additionally, we explore the results of several easy to implement proxies that have been used in literature. Our approach greatly outperforms previous ones in sex ratio prediction. Our results should help further studies to refine population-wide primary sex ratio estimates of reptiles with TSD to adapt current conservation strategies and develop them in the future.},

Increasingly, modellers are tasked with integrating data from multiple sources, collected via different observation processes. Distance sampling is an efﬁcient and widely used survey and analysis technique. Within this framework, observation processes are modelled via detection functions. We seek to take multiple data sources and ﬁt them in a single spatial model. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach: ﬁrst accounting for detectability via distance sampling methods, then modelling distribution via a generalized additive model. However, current software and theory does not address the issue of multiple data sources. We extend the DSM approach to accommodate data from multiple surveys, collected via conventional distance sampling, double-observer distance sampling (used to account for incomplete detection at zero distance) and strip transects. Variance propagation ensures that uncertainty is correctly accounted for in ﬁnal estimates of abundance. Methods described here are implemented in the dsm R package. We brieﬂy analyse two datasets to illustrate these new developments. Our new methodology enables data from multiple distance sampling surveys of different types to be treated in a single spatial model, enabling more robust abundance estimation, potentially over wider geographical or temporal domains.},

Average turtle size (­ SCLmin) and mass declined by 22.3\% and 58.2\%, respectively. Aggregation size structure shifted to smaller sizes and now consists of more small turtles and fewer large turtles. Density (turtles h­ a−1) increased significantly but biomass (kg ­ha−1) remained unchanged and low compared to C. mydas biomass observed elsewhere. Green turtles exhibited reduced site fidelity during two portions of the study period, suggesting increased foraging effort. Reduction in turtle body condition index and seagrass coverage occurred from offshore to inshore. Changes in aggregation composition and behavior were consistent with expectations given a documented decline in seagrass availability, combined with increased output from source rookeries. Apparent response to resource decline is traced back to 1976, well before seagrass loss was first documented. Green turtles and their primary food source (Thalassia testudinum) are at the northern limit of their range in Bermuda, where seagrasses would be expected to have a reduced tolerance for natural grazing pressure and increased susceptibility to synergistic stressors, especially temperature, bioturbation and phosphorus limitation. Our results suggest that synergistic stressors, and not green turtles alone, have produced the observed reduction in seagrasses on the Bermuda Platform. Given that seagrass declines have been reported worldwide, our findings may suggest how green turtles will respond elsewhere.},

Tracking data can be used by resource managers to protect habitat and ensure recovery of threatened and endangered species. Few tracking studies have focused on habitat use patterns of juvenile, neritic stage turtles. Satellite tracking surveys were conducted to assess juvenile green turtle movements in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico during 2006–2010. Fifteen turtles were equipped with platform terminal transmitters (PTT; 3 rehabilitated, 12 wild). Mean track duration was 129 days (range: 16–344 days). A hierarchical switching state-space model (hSSM) was applied to extrapolate population level foraging/resident versus migratory movements. All turtles displayed residency in Texas bays during summer months (March-November) while ﬁve individuals exhibited seasonal migrations into Mexican waters following passage of strong cold fronts in December and January. Winter (e.g., Mexico) versus summer (e.g., Texas) core areas were not signiﬁcantly different. Winter 95\% contours were signiﬁcantly larger than summer (summer: 125.4 ± 47.5 km2, n = 15; winter: 274.4 ± 252.9 km2, n = 5). Space-time hot spot analysis provided a new and unique approach for conducting spatiotemporal cluster analysis, and was applied to migratory turtles to determine monthly changes in distribution and habitat associations. Changes in hot spots over time were detected within the lower regions of the Laguna Madre with punctuated intervals of hot spot activity. Upper regions of the Laguna Madre were identiﬁed as new hot spots in the later part of the year (e.g., Fall/Winter). Within core areas in Texas, seagrasses comprised an average density of 32.4\% while 87.5\% of the total available seagrass habitat occurred within the 95\% KDE contour. Based on PTT and historic tide station surface water temperatures, all turtles tracked over winter migrations and residencies (n = 5) remained within waters {\textgreater} 15◦C, suggesting a threshold temperature at which migration behavior may be initiated. Continued recovery of threatened and endangered sea turtle populations depends on a comprehensive examination of patterns in habitat use. These data suggest cooperation between the United States and Mexico is needed to protect critical habitat and enhance recovery of this species.},

The rapid global advancement of offshore wind coupled with its potential to affect marine life compels an urgent need for robust methodologies to assess the impacts of this industry on ﬁsheries resource species. Basic Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) and Control-Impact (CI) designs are the most common experimental designs used to study the effects of offshore wind development on ﬁsheries resources. These designs do not account for spatial heterogeneity which presents a challenge because empirical evidence shows that impact gradients occur at wind farms, with larger effect sizes close to turbine foundations that attenuate with increasing distance. Combining the before-after sampling design with distancebased methods could provide a powerful approach for characterizing both the spatial and temporal variance associated with wind development. Toward enhancing future monitoring designs for ﬁsheries resource species at offshore wind farms, this paper aims to: (1) examine distance-based sampling methods that have been or could potentially be used to study impacts on ﬁsheries resources at offshore wind farms including distancestratiﬁed BACI, distance-stratiﬁed CI, Before-After-Gradient (BAG), and After-Gradient (AG) methods; (2) synthesize the methods and ﬁndings of studies conducted to date that have used distance-based methods to examine ecological impacts of offshore wind development for benthic macroinvertebrates, ﬁnﬁsh, birds, and small mammals; (3) examine some of the central methodological elements and issues to consider in developing distance-based impact studies; and (4) offer recommendations for how to incorporate distance-based sampling methods into monitoring plans at offshore wind farms.},

Noninvasive marks include natural pelt or skin patterns, scars, and genetic markers that enable individual identiﬁcation in lieu of physical capture. multimark provides a means for combining and jointly analyzing encounter histories from multiple noninvasive sources that otherwise cannot be reliably matched (e.g., left- and right-sided photographs of bilaterally asymmetrical individuals). The package is currently capable of ﬁtting open population Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) and closed population abundance models with up to two mark types using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. multimark can also be used for Bayesian analyses of conventional capture–recapture data consisting of a single-mark type. Some package features include (1) general model speciﬁcation using formulas already familiar to most R users, (2) ability to include temporal, behavioral, age, cohort, and individual heterogeneity effects in detection and survival probabilities, (3) improved MCMC algorithm that is computationally faster and more efﬁcient than previously proposed methods, (4) Bayesian multimodel inference using reversible jump MCMC, and (5) data simulation capabilities for power analyses and assessing model performance. I demonstrate use of multimark using left- and right-sided encounter histories for bobcats (Lynx rufus) collected from remote single-camera stations in southern California. In this example, there is evidence of a behavioral effect (i.e., trap “happy” response) that is otherwise indiscernible using conventional single-sided analyses. The package will be most useful to ecologists seeking stronger inferences by combining different sources of mark–recapture data that are difﬁcult (or impossible) to reliably reconcile, particularly with the sparse datasets typical of rare or elusive species for which noninvasive sampling techniques are most commonly employed. Addressing deﬁciencies in currently available software, multimark also provides a user-friendly interface for performing Bayesian multimodel inference using capture–recapture data consisting of a single conventional mark or multiple noninvasive marks.},

	abstract = {Water temperature plays a critical role in mediating energy budgets and influencing the behavior of marine ectotherms. Previous research has demonstrated that marine ectotherms such as sea turtles conserve energy by decreasing activity levels in colder water — often at or near the latitudinal limits of their range. San Diego Bay is near the northern edge of the range for eastern Pacific green turtles and is home to a year-round foraging population. Turtles in San Diego Bay experienced a significant decrease in ambient water temperature following the closure of a fossil-fuel-based power plant and corresponding loss of the plant’s warm-water effluent. Time− depth recorders were placed on 13 turtles before (n = 5) and after (n = 8) the closure of this plant to determine how changing water temperature influenced dive duration. Deployments lasted 2−25 d, with a mean deployment of 7.5 d. Green turtle behavior in different thermal regimes revealed a strong relationship between dive duration and water temperature; dive duration was significantly longer when water temperatures were colder, especially when water was below 14.4°C. Establishing the inactivity threshold for this population is critical to future management in light of temperature variability in coastal habitats and the impacts this may have on sea turtle energetics. Understanding organismal response to relatively rapid shifts in thermal conditions is relevant to assessments of the direct and indirect anthropogenic effects on aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {Background:  Ocean water temperature is changing as a result of anthropogenic influences on the marine environment. Highly mobile marine ectotherms, such as sea turtles, may be particularly susceptible to these changes. However, our current understanding of location-specific thermal tolerances, especially at coastal foraging or over-wintering areas, is limited. Human-induced changes, such as thermal effluent from power plants, appear to have a suite of influences on species that reside in affected areas. Here, we describe a study of green turtle habitat use related to changing water temperature at a coastal foraging site that has recently experienced a power plant closure, leading to a transition to cooler ambient water temperature. We used a combination of active and passive acoustic telemetry to monitor green turtle distribution in relation to water temperature in this dynamic thermal environment.
Results:  Both before and after closure of the power plant, turtles were distributed in significantly warmer waters than surrounding environments during winter months (December–February). Turtles in winter were rarely detected in water temperatures lower than 14.5 °C. Body size was negatively correlated with water temperature after closure of the power plant, with larger turtles found in cooler waters, while smaller turtles remained within warmer areas. There was not a significant relationship between body size and water temperature before closure of the power plant as water temperature was more constant during operation.
Conclusions:  Green turtles in San Diego Bay experienced a shift in water temperature following the loss of thermal effluent from a power plant. The effects of this shift were particularly evident during winter months, when ambient water temperatures were coolest. Water temperatures in the southern region of San Diego Bay were significantly warmer during winter before the closure of the power plant, and turtles were detected in significantly warmer water. Turtles in San Diego Bay may associate with or seek out thermal refugia, when possible, to avoid low water temperatures. The cold water temperature inactivity threshold for East Pacific green turtles may be lower than previously thought. There was a significant negative relationship between turtle size and water temperature after power plant closure. East Pacific green turtles exhibit clear responses in habitat use to changes in water temperature at a foraging site near the edge of their geographic range.},

	abstract = {Nontargeted GC×GC-TOF/MS analysis of blubber from 8 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the Southern California Bight was performed to identify novel, bioaccumulative DDT-related compounds and to determine their abundance relative to the commonly studied DDT-related compounds. We identiﬁed 45 bioaccumulative DDT-related compounds of which the majority (80\%) is not typically monitored in environmental media. Identiﬁed compounds include transformation products, technical mixture impurities such as tris(chlorophenyl)methane (TCPM), the presumed TCPM metabolite tris(chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH), and structurally related compounds with unknown sources, such as hexa- to octachlorinated diphenylethene. To investigate impurities in pesticide mixtures as possible sources of these compounds, we analyzed technical DDT, the primary source of historical contamination in the region, and technical Dicofol, a current use pesticide that contains DDT-related compounds. The technical mixtures contained only 33\% of the compounds identiﬁed in the blubber, suggesting that transformation products contribute to the majority of the load of DDT-related contaminants in these sentinels of ocean health. Quantitative analysis revealed that TCPM was the second most abundant compound class detected in the blubber, following DDE, and TCPMOH loads were greater than DDT. QSPR estimates veriﬁed 4,4′,4″-TCPM and 4,4′4,″-TCPMOH are persistent and bioaccumulative.},

	abstract = {Almost nothing is known about the historical abundance of the ocean sunfish. Yet as an ecologically and functionally important taxa, understanding changes in abundance may be a useful indicator of how our seas are responding to anthropogenic changes including overfishing and climate change. Within this context, sightings from a coastal bird observatory (51.26◦ N, 9.30◦ W) over a 47 year period (from April to October 1971–2017) provided the first long-term index of sunfish abundance. Using a general linear mixed effect model with a hurdle to deal with imperfect detectability and to model trends, a higher probability of detecting sunfish was found in the 1990s and 2000s. Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) phytoplankton color indices and the annual mean position of the 13 ◦ C sea surface isotherm were significantly correlated with the probability of detecting sunfish. An increase in siphonophore abundance (as measured by the CPR) was also documented. However, this increase occurred 10–15 years after the sunfish increase and was not significantly correlated with sunfish abundance. Our results suggest that the observed increase in sunfish sightings is evidence of a range expansion because it was significantly correlated with the mean position of the 13 ◦ C isotherm which moved northwards by over 200 km. Furthermore, the observed increase in sunfish occured 10 years before sunfish sightings are documented in Icelandic and Norwegian waters, and was concurrent with well-known range expansions for other fish species during the 1990s. This study demonstrates how sustained citizen science projects can provide unique insights on the historical abundance of this enigmatic species.},

Combined with advancements in remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS, commonly ‘drones’), infrared thermography (IRT) is being increasingly used to detect and count marine mammals and study their physiology. We conducted RPAS-based IRT over NARWs in Cape Cod Bay, MA, USA, in 2017 and 2018. Observations demonstrated 3 particularly useful applications of RPAS-based IRT to study large whales: (1) exploring patterns of cranial heat loss and providing insight into the physiological mechanisms that produce these patterns; (2) tracking subsurface individuals in real-time (depending on the thermal stratification of the water column) using cold surface water anomalies resulting from fluke upstrokes; and (3) detecting natural changes in superficial blood circulation or diagnosing pathology based on heat anomalies on post-cranial body surfaces. These qualitative applications present a new, important opportunity to study, monitor, and conserve large whales, particularly rare and at-risk species such as NARWs. Despite the challenges of using this technology in aquatic environments, the applications of RPAS-based IRT for monitoring the health and behavior of endangered marine mammals, including the collection of quantitative data on thermal physiology, will continue to diversify.},

From the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula to the southeastern Weddell Sea, we classified the investigated stations into 5 categories according to their summer sea-ice cover: (I) none (Drake Passage), (II) irregular (Bransfield Strait), (III) seasonal (northwestern Weddell Sea), (IV) high (South Filchner Trough), and (V) constant (North Filchner Trough). The categories differed significantly in primary-production-related characteristics in the water column and food availability at the seafloor. Almost all ice-cover categories differed significantly in meiofauna communities (32-500 µm, 20 taxa, 585 825 individuals). Fewer regions differed significantly in macrofauna ({\textgreater}500 µm, 19 taxa, 3974 individuals) or the combined meiofauna and macrofauna communities. Environmental drivers explained {\textgreater}66\% of the variation among different communities and differed for the faunal size classes: for meiofauna (84.2\%), sea-ice cover (1 yr) and availability of fresh food (chlorophyll a [chl a]) were most important, whereas 1 yr ice cover, chl a, and total organic carbon were decisive drivers for macrofauna (66.6\%). Grain size, water depth, water-column chl a, long-term ice cover, seafloor temperature, and the carbon/nitrogen ratio influenced communities to a lesser extent. We demonstrated a stronger relationship with sea-ice cover in meiofauna communities than in macrofauna communities, and we recommend including meiofauna in future assessments of the influence of environmental changes on Southern Ocean ecosystems.},

	abstract = {An understanding of animal grouping patterns is essential to increase knowledge about their social systems. We used a 5-year continuous dataset to investigate grouping behavior in a free-ranging highly social mammal, the bottlenose dolphin. Our objective was achieved by examining the relationships between a set of oceanographic, climatic, topographic, anthropogenic and social variables and bottlenose dolphin group size. Modeling analysis revealed that bottlenose dolphin group dynamics was linked to both small-scale oceanographic variation and large-scale climatic variation. Larger groups of bottlenose dolphins were predicted with an elevated concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water column, a moderate concentration of chlorophyll-a 60 days before each encounter, and a neutral NAO index. The observed link between environmental variables and dolphin group size is likely associated to changes in dolphin prey availability. Bottlenose dolphin group dynamics are likely driven by multiple factors, and social variables may act synergistically with environmental parameters. Larger groups of bottlenose dolphins were indeed also predicted with a greater number of dependent calves, likely because of enhanced care towards the calves. This study illustrates the value of using multiple variables at different scales to explore the factors that shape animal societies. The current study therefore contributes to the growing body of literature on how environmental change, occurring at different spatio-temporal scales, is indirectly related to the social behavior of a marine top predator.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

	abstract = {Penalized splines, or P-splines, are regression splines fit by least-squares with a roughness penalty.P-splines have much in common with smoothing splines, but the type of penalty used with a P-spline is somewhat more general than for a smoothing spline. Also, the number and location of the knots of a P-spline is not fixed as with a smoothing spline. Generally, the knots of a P-spline are at fixed quantiles of the independent variable and the only tuning parameters to choose are the number of knots and the penalty parameter. In this article, the effects of the number of knots on the performance of P-splines are studied. Two algorithms are proposed for the automatic selection of the number of knots. The myopic algorithm stops when no improvement in the generalized cross-validation statistic (GCV) is noticed with the last increase in the number of knots. The full search examines all candidates in a fixed sequence of possible numbers of knots and chooses the candidate that minimizes GCV.The myopic algorithm works well in many cases but can stop prematurely. The full-search algorithm worked well in all examples examined. A Demmler–Reinsch type diagonalization for computing univariate and additive P-splines is described. The Demmler–Reinsch basis is not effective for smoothing splines because smoothing splines have too many knots. For P-splines, however, the Demmler–Reinsch basis is very useful for super-fast generalized cross-validation.},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {The southbound migration of the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) was documented by the National
Marine Fisheries Service from 13 December 1997 to 24 February 1998, 13 December 2000 to 5 March 2001 and from 12 December 2001
to 5 March 2002. Research protocol was essentially identical to that used in previous surveys. This involved single observers independently
searching for whales and recording data on effort and sighting time, location, count and direction-headed. In 1997/98, there were 2,346 pods
(3,643 whales) counted during 435.0h of standard observational effort when visibility was recorded as fair to excellent. In 2000/01, a total
of 1,694 pods (2,754 whales) were counted during 592.4h, and in 2001/02, there were 1,712 pods (2,800 whales) during 531.5h. The
southbound migrations in 1997/98 and 2001/02 were normal, beginning in mid-December, centred on mid-January (mean dates=18 January
1998 and 15 January 2002 respectively) and ending by mid-February. However, in 2000/01 (mean date=25 January 2001) the migration was
more protracted than any other migration observed in the past 25 years, with many whales still travelling south three weeks after the typical
end date. Data analysis procedures were comparable to those used in previous years, with the exception of a new correction factor for nighttime travel rates. Abundance estimates were 29,758 whales in 1997/98 (CV=10.49\%; 95\% log-normal confidence interval=24,241 to
36,531), 19,448 in 2000/01 (CV=9.67\%; 95\% log-normal confidence interval=16,096 to 23,498) and 18,178 in 2001/02 (CV=9.79\%; 95\%
log-normal confidence interval=15,010 to 22,015). The abundance in 1997/98 was the highest estimate made since this project began in
1967/68. It was followed by two much lower estimates – probably related to the high mortality rates observed in 1999 and 2000. This whale
population appears to be approaching the carrying-capacity of its environment.},

	abstract = {Space–time modeling of small area data is often used in epidemiology for mapping chronic disease rates and by government statistical agencies for producing local estimates of, for example, unemployment or crime rates. Although there is typically a general temporal trend, which affects all areas similarly, abrupt changes may occur in a particular area, e.g. due to emergence of localized predictors/risk factor(s) or impact of a new policy. Detection of areas with “unusual” temporal patterns is therefore important as a screening tool for further investigations. In this paper, we propose BaySTDetect, a novel detection method for short-time series of small area data using Bayesian model choice between two competing space–time models. The first model is a multiplicative decomposition of the area effect and the temporal effect, assuming one common temporal pattern across the whole study region. The second model estimates the time trends independently for each area. For each area, the posterior probability of belonging to the common trend model is calculated, which is then used to classify the local time trend as unusual or not. Crucial to any detection method, we provide a Bayesian estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR). A comprehensive simulation study has demonstrated the consistent good performance of BaySTDetect in detecting various realistic departure patterns in addition to estimating well the FDR. The proposed method is applied retrospectively to mortality data on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in England and Wales between 1990 and 1997 (a) to test a hypothesis that a government policy increased the diagnosis of COPD and (b) to perform surveillance. While results showed no evidence supporting the hypothesis regarding the policy, an identified unusual district (Tower Hamlets in inner London) was later recognized to have higher than national rates of hospital readmission and mortality due to COPD by the National Health Service, which initiated various local enhanced services to tackle the problem. Our method would have led to an early detection of this local health issue.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The 1987-1988 counts of gray whales passing Monterey are reanalyzed to provide a revised population size estimate. The double count data are modeled using iterative logistic regression to allow for the effects of various covariates on probability of detection, and a correction factor is introduced for night rate of travel. The revised absolute population size estimate is 20,869 animals, with CV = 4.37\% and 95\% confidence interval (19,200, 22,700). In addition the series of relative population size estimates from 1967-1968 to 1987-1988 is scaled to pass through this estimate and modeled to provide variance estimates from interannual variation in population size estimates. This method yields an alternative population size estimate for 1987-1988 of 21,296 animals, with CV = 6.05\% and 95\% confidence interval (18,900, 24,000). The average annual rate of increase between 1967-1968 and 1987-1988 was estimated to be 3.29\% with standard error 0.44\%.},
