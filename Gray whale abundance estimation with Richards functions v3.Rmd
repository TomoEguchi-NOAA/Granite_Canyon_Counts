## Introduction {.unnumbered}
*A paragraph on gray whales*

Analytical methods to estimate abundance of gray whales from visual surveys at Granite Canyon, CA, have evolved over the years [@laakeGrayWhaleSouthbound2012; @durbanEstimatingGrayWhale2015]. Laake et al. (2012) used the distance sampling approach with generalized additive models (GAMs). Durban et al. (2015) developed a new method using a Bayesian N-mixture approach, which was approved by the IWC and it has been used for the analysis since the 2015/2016 season. In short, Durban et al.'s method used the observed changes in migrating gray whales at a location along the migration corridor. The general trend is that the number of gray whale sightings increases over time until it reaches its peak, then decreases. Durban et al.'s method used the Gaussian function to capture this general trend. Deviations from the Gaussian function was modeled via fitting a spline function to the observed counts.

The analysis was conducted using WinBUGS, which had become obsolete over the last decade or so. In this report, I provide improvements to Durban et al.'s method. In the following, I first describe the method by Durban et al. and point out underlying assumptions. Then, I introduce a new approach that is consistent with the basic idea of the method by Durban et al. but improve it by replacing the Gaussian/spline model with another function. Finally, I reanalyze the real data from Granite Canyon, CA, to compare abundance estimates among the three approaches.

## Method by Durban et al. {.unnumbered}

At the field station located at Granite Canyon, CA, in order to estimate detectability of gray whales by visual observers, counts from two independent stations of paired observers operating simultaneously were compared during two years (2009/2010 and 2010/2011). The two watch stations were positioned 35 m apart at the same elevation (22.5 m) above sea level (Durban et al. 2015). For the years with only one station, detectability was extrapolated for all monitored watch periods based on the fitted model for detectability, where the counts for the south watch station were treated as zero inflated binomial outcomes. The binomial probability was specified as the product of an indicator function and the detectability ($u_{i,j,t} \times p_{i,j,t}$), where $u$ = 1 or 0 to indicate whether or not count data were collected from that station. This formulation ensured that structural zero counts from periods without a second watch did not contribute to the likelihood for estimation of $p$ or $N$ (Durban et al. 2015).

Consistent with Laake et al. (2012), the model for detectability incorporated fixed effects for visibility ($V$) and the Beaufort sea state ($B$), whereas observers were treated as random effects ($O$). These were modeled as additive effects on a general intercept so that the direction and magnitude of the estimated effects away from zero (no effect) could be assessed. The selection for the inclusion of these effects were accomplished by using Bayesian model selection with stochastic binary indicator variables $I$ to switch each of the three possible effects either in or out of the model.

### Mathematical description {.unnumbered}

This section was extracted from Durban et al. (2015), almost verbatim. I edited some places to make explanations clearer in my mind and changed some symbols to make them consistent between theirs and my proposed approach, which is described later in this document.

The total counts of whales ($n_{i,d(j),t}$) during the watch period $j$ of the $d$th day in the year $t$ at the watch station $i$ was modeled as a binomial random deviate (in the paper, $j$ was not specified as the $j$th watch period during the $d$th day of the season):

$$ n_{i,d(j),t} \sim BIN(N_{d(j),t}, p_{i,d(j),t}). $$

The binomial $N_{d(j),t}$ parameter is the unknown total number of gray whales passing through the study area during the watch period $j$ in the $d$th day in the year $t$.

The detection probability was modeled as a function of visibility (V), Beaufort scale (B), and observers (O).

$$ logit(p_{i,d(j),t}) = logit(p_0) + I_{V} \beta_{V} V_{d(j),t} + I_{B} \beta_{B} B_{d(j),t}+ I_{O} \mathbf{\beta}^{O_{i,d(j),t} = o}_{O} $$

where the intercept $p_0$ was the base detection probability in the absence of covariate effects, assigned a Uniform(0,1) prior distribution, and $logit(p_0) = ln(p_0/(1–p_0))$. For each fixed effect, $\beta_{B}$ and $\beta_{V}$, a Normal prior distribution with mean zero and standard deviation of 10 was used. The random effect for each observer was drawn from a Normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma_{O} \sim Uniform(0,10)$. Each binary indicator variable, I, was assigned a Bernoulli(0.5) distribution to specify equal probability of inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of the effect in the model (Durban et al. 2015).

A Poisson distribution ($N_{d(j),t} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{d(j),t})$) was used as a hierarchical prior for the distribution of abundances, and specified a model for the Poisson mean ($\lambda$) in terms of the number of whales passing each day ($d$), with an offset for the effort duration of each watch period, $E_{d(j),t}$ in decimal days (Laake et al., 2012):

$$ log(\lambda_{d(j),t}) = log(E_{d(j),t}) + model_{d,t}$$

$$ model_{d,t} = z_{d,t} f_{d,t} + (1 – z_{d,t}) g_{d,t} $$

where $z_{d,t}$ is an indicator function (see below). $f_{d,t}$ and $g_{d,t}$ also are explained below.

Days were specified as d = 0 to 90, where days were counted from 12:00am on 1 December, and we added an abundance of 0 whales passing for day 0 and 90 to anchor the fitted model when we assumed whales did not pass (Buckland et al. 1993).

Estimates were derived from either of two competing models ['Common' ($f$) and 'Specific' ($g$), e.g., @li2012] describing changes in abundance across each annual migration. The model contributing each daily estimate was indicated using stochastic binary indicator variables $z_{d,t}$, each assigned a Bernoulli(0.5) prior distribution. As such, the posterior distribution of each $z_{d,t}$ indicated the probability of a daily estimate conforming to the common trend, allowing flexibility for departures from this trend that may only exist on certain days in certain years to be identified and modeled (rather than assuming all counts from an entire year conform to or depart from a common trend). The total number of whales passing at the survey location during each migration was then estimated by summing the expected value from the model averaged number of whales passing each day ($d$) from 0 to 90 (Laake et al., 2012).

These estimates were then rescaled to account for the differential passage rate at night (Perryman et al., 1999), based on the nine hour day multiplicative correction factor [@rugh2005]. Specifically, we applied a constant night time correction factor that was assumed to be a Normally distributed fixed effect with mean of 1.0875 and standard deviation of 0.037 [@perryman1999a].

For the 'Common model' ($f_{d,t}$), we assumed a typical trend in abundance throughout each annual migration (e.g. Buckland et al., 1993), with abundance changes assumed Normally distributed around a migration mid-point. A Normal distribution was specified as a quadratic function of days, on the log scale:

$$f_{d,t} = a_t + b_t *d_t + c_t * d^2_t$$

where the mid-point of the migration curve for each year $t$ was derived by $–b_t/2a_t$. This assumed common migration curve allowed information to be 'borrowed' across years when needed, specifying association across years to strengthen inference about migration curves in years with relatively sparse counts. Each parameter was specified to be drawn from a hierarchical Normal distribution.

$$ a_t \sim Normal(\mu_a, \sigma_a)$$

$$ b_t \sim Normal(\mu_b, \sigma_b)$$

$$ c_t \sim Normal(\mu_c, \sigma_c)$$

and $\mu \sim Normal(0, 10)$ and $\sigma \sim Uniform(0, 10)$, for $a$, $b$, and $c$.

This hierarchical and random effects approach allowed the timing, level and extent of the Normal migration curve to vary annually around the general pattern, if supported by the data.

To acknowledge and incorporate deviations from the common Normal model, the selection of an alternative 'specific' migration model was allowed ($g_{d,t}$). The 'specific' model was a semi-parametric model that estimated the time trends independently for each year without making any prior assumptions about its form (e.g., Laake et al., 2012). In this model, the shape of the relationship of true abundance across days was determined by the data via penalized splines [@ruppert2002].

A linear (on the log scale) penalized spline was used to describe this relationship [@crainiceanu2005]:

$$ g_{d,t} = S_{0,t} + S_{1,t} * d_t + \sum_{k=1}^{m} \lambda_{k,t} (d_t – \kappa_{k,t}) $$ Where $S_{0,t}, S_{1,t}$ and $\lambda_{1,t}, \dots, \lambda_{m,t}$ were regression coefficients to be estimated separately for each year and $\kappa_{1,t} < \kappa_{2,t} < \dots < \kappa_{m,t}$ were fixed knots. To ensure the desired flexibility, we used m = 15 knots, which is a relatively large number. To avoid overfitting, the $\lambda$'s were penalized by assuming that they were Normally distributed random variables with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sim Uniform(0,10)$. The parameters $S_{0,t}, S_{1,t}$ were modeled as fixed effects with Normal(0, 10) prior distributions.

### Some concerns about Durban et al's method {.unnumbered}

The approach in Durban et al. (2015) used the "cut" function within WinBUGS to dissociate estimated parameters in one function (i.e., $f_{d,t}$ or $g_{d,t}$) from those in the other function (i.e., $g_{d,t}$ or $f_{d,t}$, respectively). The function (\cut) is unavailable in modern Bayesian computation packages (e.g., JAGS, STAN) and its use has been questioned [@plummer2015]. In short, "cut" function does not converge to a well-defined limiting distribution (Plummer 2015). In addition, the assumption that the number of gray whales migrating in front of the observation station follows a Gaussian distribution centered around the mid point of the pre-defined migration season is somewhat questionable. The true curve in abundance may not be symmetric around a peak and the peak may not be instantaneous. In other words, the peak may persist for a few days. Fitting spline functions to observed counts may alleviate some of these problems but a fitted spline to observed counts may be too flexible. A spline fit would lose the general idea that the number of whales increases from the beginning of a migration season, reaches a peak, then decreases over time to the end of the migration season. In addition, Durban et al.'s approach assumed that two observation stations operated simultaneously with identical effort. In reality, however, watch durations were not identical between two stations in previous years (i.e., data in Laake's analysis).

## Modification {.unnumbered}

Because of the way spline is fit to data points, it is impossible to use just spline when data are not collected from day 1. Missing data points (weekends, not having 90 days of observations) are linearly interpolated unless there is an assumed data generating model (the Normal distribution in the approach by Durban et al.) that is common among years. Instead of using Normal and spline functions, I use one flexible function (Richards function).

### Model description {.unnumbered}

In order to overcome these difficulties with the previous approach, I use a more flexible function that can accommodate the general shape (increase, peak then decrease) and asymmetrical around the peak. The function is called Richards' function [@richards1959] and it has been used, for example, to model changes in the number of nesting turtles [@girondotModelingApproachesQuantify2007]. The model is defined as follows.

$$M_1 = (1 + (2 e^K - 1) * e^{(P-d)/S_1}) ^ {(-1/e^K)}$$

$$M_2 = (1 + (2 e^K - 1) * e^{(P-d)/S_2}) ^ {(-1/e^K)}$$

$$N = N_{min} + (N_{max} - N_{min}) * (M_1 * M_2),$$

where $d$ is the number of days from the day that first gray whale migrate through the sampling location, or the number of days since an arbitrary date,

$S_1 < 0$ and $S_2 > 0$ define how the slope decreases and increases, respectively,

$K > 0$ defines the "flatness" at the peak of the function,

$P$ defines where the peak is relative to the range of $d$, where $min(d) < P < max(d)$,

$N_{min}$ is zero, i.e., the number of whales migrating outside of a migration season and,

$N_{max} >> N_{min}$. $N_{max}$ is not the maximum number of whales migrating per day but it is a parameter that may be fixed or estimated during the analysis.

Effects of these parameters on the shape of the function are described in the following section.

### Function characteristics {.unnumbered}

#### Effects of $S_1$ {.unnumbered}

The parameter $S_1 < 0$ defines how the curve decreases from its peak. The rate of decline slows down as $S_1$ becomes greater (i.e., closer to zero; Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-S1)). Because we make an assumption that there are no whales migrating after day 90 (or any other assumed "end" day), the lower bound of $S_1$ can be restricted to a certain value, (e.g., $-5 < S_1 < 0$).

                                            S2 = S2,

knitr::include_graphics(paste0("figures/S1_", dpi.set, "dpi.png"))

```

#### Effects of $S_2$ {.unnumbered}

The parameter $S_2 > 0$ defines how the curve increases to its peak. The rate of increase slows down as $S_2$ becomes larger (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-S2)). Because we make an assumption that there are no whales migrating before day 1, the upper bound of $S_2$ can be restricted to a certain value (e.g., $0 < S_2 <5$).

```{r S2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
S1 <- -1.5

```

#### Effects of K {.unnumbered}

The parameter $K > 0$ defines the flatness of the curve at its peak. Greater $K$ values correspond to flatter peaks (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-K)). Similarly to $S_1$ and $S_2$, the upper bound of $K$ may be defined based on the assumption that the numbers of migrating gray whales are zero at day 1 and 90 (e.g., $0 < K < max(K)$). The upper bound ($max(K)$) may change when other parameters change, such as $S_1$ and $S_2$.

```{r K, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
S1 <- -2.5
S2 <- 2.5
K <- c(0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 4, 8)
P <- 40
max.N <- 800

The parameter $P$ defines the location of its peak (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-P)).

#### Fitting the model to observed counts {.unnumbered}

The proposed new approach replaces the spline-Gaussian selection step in Durban et al. with Richards' function. The observed counts are modeled with binomial distributions as it was in Durban et al. (2015)

$$ n_{i_t,s,y} \sim BIN(N_{t, y}, p_{i_t, s, y} * \theta_{i_t, y}) $$

where $n_{i_t, s, y}$ is the observed number of gray whales during the watch period $i$ of the $t$-th day of the season $y$ from the station $s$, $N_{t, y}$ is the number of gray whales that migrated through the sampling area during the $t$-th day of season $y$, $p_{i_t, s, y}$ is the sighting probability of the station $s$ during the watch period $i$ of the $t$-th day of the season $y$, and $\theta_{i_t,y}$ is the fractional duration of the watch period $i_t$ in the units of days. This is identical to Durban's approach. 

The sighting probability $p_{i_t, s, y}$ is modeled as a function of the Beaufort sea state ($B$), visibility ($V$), and observers ($O$). Beaufort sea state and visibility were treated as fixed effects, whereas observers were treated as random effects. I removed the indicator function that selected covariates in Durban's approach. Whether or not each variable was needed would be apparent from the coefficient (i.e., $\beta$). 

$$ logit(p_{i_t, s, y}) = \beta_0 + \beta_{B} * B_{i_t, y} + \beta_{V} * V_{i_t, y} + O_{i_t, s, y}  $$

This is identical to how the sighting probability was modeled in Durban et al. (2015). I grouped all observers who had less than 10 observation periods.  

The number of gray whales that migrated through the sampling area during the $t$-th day of the season was modeled as a Poisson variable with the mean $\bar{N}_{t, y}$ [@raftery1988].

$$ N_{t, y} \sim POI(\bar{N}_{t,y}) $$

where $\bar{N}_{t,y}$ is the expected number of whales that migrate through the sampling area on the $t$-th day of the season $y$ and modeled with the Richards function above.

The total number of gray whales for season $y$ is the sum of all $N_{t, y}$ and corrected for nighttime passage:

$$ N_y = \lambda * \sum_{t = 1} ^ {90} N_{t, y} $$ and

$$ \lambda \sim N(1.0875, 0.03625) $$ (Perryman et al. 1999).


#### Reanalysis of the last 8 seasons {.unnumbered}

Data from last 9 seasons were analyzed using the new approach and the results compared to results from Durban et al's approach.

Convergence was not reached for all parameters where the maximum $\hat{R}$ statistic was `r signif(max.r.hat.real, 3)`. There were `r length(which(unlist(jm.out.real$jm$Rhat) > 1.1))` parameters that resulted in $\hat{R}$ statistic \> 1.1. A closer examination of $\hat{R}$ statistics revealed that high values were associated with the mean.N and N parameters, as well as the parameters for Richards function (S1, S2, and P) for the 2015/2016 season.

Similarly to the analysis of simulated data, daily estimates were generally less for the new approach than Durban's approach (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-daily-N-hats)). Estimates from the new approach was more precise than those from Durban's method. As a consequence, annual estimates also were greater for Durban's method than for the new approach and precision was better for the new approach (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-N-hats)).

```{r Figure-daily-N-hats, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap = "Estimated dailyt abundance and their 95% CIs using Durban's method (green) and new approach (blue)."}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0("figures/N_hats_BUGS_JAGS_real_", model.d,   model.v, "_", dpi.set, "dpi.png"))
```

#### Application of the novel approach to data in Laake et al. {-}

In this section, I apply the novel approach of estimating the abundance of gray whale from data collected by visual surveys at Granite Canyon from the 1967/1968 season to 2006/2007 season. The data were obtained from Jeff Laake via Github (https://github.com/jlaake/ERAnalysis/tree/master/ERAnalysis). These data were analyzed and results published (Laake et al. 2012).
