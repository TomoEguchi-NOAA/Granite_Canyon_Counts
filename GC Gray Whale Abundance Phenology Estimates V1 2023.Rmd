## Introduction {.unnumbered}

The Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) regularly conducts shore-based surveys of eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whales (*Eschrichtius robustus*) to estimate abundance. These estimates are obtained from visual survey data collected off central California between December and February during the gray whale southward migration, and provide regular updates to a time series of abundance estimates that began in 1967 [@laake2012; @durbanEstimatingGrayWhale2015]. Surveys have recorded a generally increasing trend in ENP gray whale abundance until the 2015/2016 season. Since then, however, the trend indicated a decline from 2015/2016 of 26,960 whales (95% CI = 24,420-29,830) to 20,580 whales (95% CI = 18,700-22,970) in 2019/2020 [@stewart2021a], and 16,650 (95% CI = 15,170 - 18,335) in 2021/2022 [@eguchi2022]. Even though these estimates were greater than the estimate from 1967 (13,426 whales, CV = 0.094, Laake et al. 2012), the observed decline in the consecutive surveys raised a concern about the status of the population. This report presents a new estimate of abundance for ENP gray whales migrating southward off the central California coast between December 2022 and February 2023.

## Methods {.unnumbered}

Data for this updated abundance estimate were collected during the 2022-2023 southward ENP gray whale migration between `r min(as.Date(data.first.$V3, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% format("%d %B %Y")` and `r max(as.Date(data.last.$V3, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% format("%d %B %Y")`. Counts were made from a shore-based watch station at Granite Canyon, California, by teams of observer pairs rotating from a larger pool. These surveys are designed to target the main migration period from late December to mid-February and do not typically cover the early onset or late offset of the migration when few whales are observed. Sampling and analytical methods are described in a previous publication [@durbanEstimatingGrayWhale2015].

The estimate of abundance reported here was computed using the N-mixture modeling approach used previously by SWFSC for surveys conducted between 2006 and 2020 [Durban et al. 2015, 2017, @stewart2021a]. In this approach, the sighting probability of shore-based observers is estimated by using data from replicate surveys (i.e., data collected simultaneously by two independent observer teams) that were completed in 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 and covariates that affect sighting probabilities (i.e., visibility, sea state, and observers). These sighting probability estimates allowed the total number of whales passing through the survey area during a watch period to be estimated from the observed number of whales, even in years when replicate surveys were not conducted.

In the analysis, the start date of the southward migration for the Granite Canyon study site is fixed at 1 December and the end date at 28 February, where the number of whales passing the watch station on those two dates is assumed zero. The daily count data are assumed to be random deviates from binomial distributions with the estimated sighting probability from replicate surveys and the true number of whales in the sampling area, which is assumed to change as a function of the number of days since 1 December. The model fits two possible functions to the daily counts of whales and select a function that fits better for each count. These functions are (a) a normal distribution with the peak in the daily number of whales passing occurs at the midpoint of the migration and (b) a spline fit that allows the overall migration curve to flexibly match the observed daily counts without expectations about the shape of the curve. The model then internally selects which of these two candidate migration curves best matches the daily number of observed whales. The final abundance estimate is the sum of the total number of whales passing the survey area each day (i.e., both observed whales and the estimated number of unobserved whales), with a correction factor applied to account for a small number of whales that may pass too far offshore to be observed by shore-based observers and those that migrates through the study area at night. The modeling approach is described in detail in Durban et al. (2015; 2017).

Because the N-mixture modeling approach uses all data since 2006/2007 to estimate parameters that are shared among yearly datasets, annual estimates change as more data are added to the analysis. To be consistent with previously reported abundance estimates, we only provide the estimate for the 2022/2023 season, while keeping the previous estimates as they were reported.

To determine possible changes in migration timing, we examined the annual median migration date, which was defined previously [@rugh2001] as "the date when 50% of the whale sightings had been recorded at a research site or (if data were not available for calculating the median) the date corresponding with the apex of a unimodal sighting curve." Using the first definition, these dates are determined using sightings rather than estimated abundances. The latter definition, however, is applicable for estimated numbers, if the model has a unimodal distribution. In our approach, the model selected a better function between the normal and spline fits for each day. Consequently, the results are not unimodal for some years (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-daily-fit)). We, therefore, use the date when 50% of the whale sightings had been recorded as the median date.

Linear models were fitted to the relationship between median dates and year. In order to estimate change points, if existed, we fitted segmented linear models using the *segmented* package [v. `r packageVersion("segmented")`, @muggeo2017]. All statistical analyses were conducted within the R statistical environment (v. 4.1.2, R Core Team 2021).

### Abundance estimates {.unnumbered}

From `r format(as.Date("2022-11-30") + data.2023$Data_Out[1, "BeginDay"], "%d %B %Y")` to `r format(as.Date("2022-11-30") + data.2023$Data_Out[nrow(data.2023$Data_Out), "BeginDay"], "%d %B %Y")`, `r length(unique(data.2023$Data_Out$obs))` trained observers completed `r signif(sum(data.2023$Data_Out$dur) * 24, 4)` hours of survey effort over `r length(unique(data.2023$Data_Out$BeginDay))` survey days. Due to the inclement weather and other constraints (e.g., poor visibility due to fog), `r signif(sum(data.2023$Complete_Data$dur) * 24, 4)` hours of survey effort was retained for further analyses. A total of `r nrow(data.2023$Complete_Data)` groups of `r sum(data.2023$Complete_Data$n)` gray whales were counted, with the highest daily count of `r max(daily.counts$n.day)` whales on `r daily.counts %>% filter(n.day == max(n.day)) %>% dplyr::select("Date") %>% as.data.frame() %>% format("%d %B %Y")` (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-daily-fit)). Estimated total abundance of gray whales during the 2021/2022 southbound migration was `r Durban.estimates[x, "Nhat"] %>% format.big.number()` (95% Credible Interval: `r Durban.estimates[x, "LCL"] %>% format.big.number()` - `r Durban.estimates[x, "UCL"] %>% format.big.number()`, CV = `r signif(CV.Nhat.2023, 3)`, 20-percentile = `r quantile(WinBUGS.results$BUGS_out$sims.list$Corrected.Est[,x], 0.2) %>% format.big.number()`). This estimate includes the multiplicative correction factor for nighttime passage (mean = 1.0875, SD = 0.03625). This estimate represents a `r abs(signif((Durban.estimates[x, "Nhat"] - Durban.estimates[x-1, "Nhat"])/Durban.estimates[x-1,"Nhat"], 3)) * 100`% decline from the previous survey in 2021/2022 when abundance was estimated at `r Durban.estimates[x-1, "Nhat"] %>% format.big.number()` (Table \@ref(tab:Table-Nhats-v1)). Considering the 23.7% decline in abundance from 2016 to 2020 (Stewart and Weller 2021a) and the `r abs(signif((Durban.estimates[x-1, "Nhat"] - Durban.estimates[x-2, "Nhat"])/Durban.estimates[x-2,"Nhat"], 3)) * 100`% decline from 2019/2020 to 2020/2021 (Eguchi et al. 2022), a striking decrease in the numbers of ENP gray whales occurred since 2016 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-nhats-v1)).

The most recent estimate of `r Durban.estimates[x, "Nhat"] %>% format.big.number()`in 2022/2023 is comparable to those from 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-nhats-v1)). Those earlier survey years coincided with an unusual mortality event (UME) that occurred in 1999 and 2000 when higher than usual strandings and deaths of gray whales were observed along the west coast of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. In total, 651 dead gray whales were reported, with 283 observed in 1999 and 368 in 2000 [@gulland2005]. While the cause of this UME was not determined, some stranded whales were in poor body condition leading to questions about whether the population of ENP gray whales had reached the limit of what the Arctic feeding ground habitat could support [@moore2001]. However, the population subsequently increased and in 2016 the abundance was estimated at its all-time high of nearly 27,000 whales.

In 2019, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service declared the most recent UME for ENP gray whales . As of March, 2023, X stranded whales were recorded with 216 in 2019, 172 in 2020, 114 in 2021 and Y in 2022, and Z in 2023. While this UME appears to be at a slightly reduced level compared to the 1999-2000 UME, it overlaps with the observed 23.7% decline in abundance from 2016 to 2020 and then the 19.6% decline in abundance that occurred between 2020 and 2022, and the 12% decline from 2022 to 2023. Given the increased number of strandings in 2019 that triggered the designation of a UME and the lower number of reported strandings since that time, it is likely that the majority of this decline occurred in 2019. This decline is comparable to that seen between 1987/1988, when the ENP gray whale population reached what was then its highest estimated abundance (26,916 whales) of the time series, and 1992/1993, when the estimated abundance had fallen approximately 40% over the course of four years. Based on the available records, this decline was not associated with a marked increase in the number of stranded whales, as was the case in 1999-2000 and 2019-present. However, by 1993/1994 abundance had increased to over 20,000, and remained stable at near that level until the 1999-2000 UME.

The pattern of population growth and decline represented in the time series of abundance estimates for ENP gray whales suggests that large-scale fluctuations of this nature are not rare. The observed declines in abundance appear to represent short-term events that have not resulted in any detectable longer-term impacts on the population. That is, despite occasional declines in abundance since the time-series of data began in 1967, the overall trend had remained positive. That being said, the year over year decline in abundance between 2016 and 2022 represents a pattern that requires further regular monitoring to determine when the population trajectory levels off and, in turn, again becomes positive. While ENP gray whales have shown long-term resilience to population fluctuations for which a direct cause has yet to be determined, NOAA/NMFS continue to closely monitor the population with regular surveys to estimate abundance, calf production and body condition [e.g., @perryman2002; @durbanEstimatingGrayWhale2015; @perryman2021; @stewart2021a; @stewart2021b]. The results of these research efforts will continue to provide the best scientific information available regarding the status of the population.

Timing of migration, measured by the median migration date, changed significantly over the survey period (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-phenology)). From the beginning of the survey (1967) through 1970s, they were generally earlier than 10 January (Day 40). They linearly increased over the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Since the mid 2000s, there was a linear decline. Estimated change points were `r signif(lm.1.seg.1$psi[1,2], 5)` (SE = `r signif(lm.1.seg.1$psi[1,3], 3)`) and `r signif(lm.1.seg.1$psi[2,2], 5)` (SE = `r signif(lm.1.seg.1$psi[2,3], 3)`). The estimated slopes for the three segments were `r signif(slopes$Year[1,1], 3)` (SE = `r signif(slopes$Year[1,2], 3)`), `r signif(slopes$Year[2,1], 3)` (SE = `r signif(slopes$Year[2,2], 3)`), and `r signif(slopes$Year[3,1], 3)` (SE = `r signif(slopes$Year[3,2], 3)`). ). The linear decline in the median southbound migration date since 2007 was not apparent in the median northbound migration date of mother-calf pairs, which increased by approximately one week when recent data (through 2016) was compared to that collected in the mid-1990s (Perryman et al. 2020).
